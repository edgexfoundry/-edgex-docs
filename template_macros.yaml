# version is the git branch or tag
#
# Its value is used in Github URLs
#
# In the main branch, it should always be set to "main".
# Upon releases and in edgex-docs release branches (e.g. levski, minnesota),
# the value should be replaced with the git tag that is the full semantic
# version.
#
# Examples: main, v2.3.0, v2.3.1, v3.0.0
version: main

# api_version is the major API version
#
# Examples: v2, v3
api_version: v3
