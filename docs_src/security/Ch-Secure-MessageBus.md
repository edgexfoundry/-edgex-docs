# Secure MessageBus

All the default services (Core Data, App Service Rules, Device Virtual, eKuiper, etc.) that utilize the `MessageBus` are configured out of the box to connect securely.

Additional add-on services that require `Secure MessageBus` access (App and/or Device services) need to follow the steps outline in the [Configuring Add-On Services for Security](Ch-Configuring-Add-On-Services.md) section.
