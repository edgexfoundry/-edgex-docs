# Exporting your device data

Great, so the data sent by the camera device makes it way to core data.
How can that data be sent to an enterprise system or the Cloud? How can
that data be used by an edge analytics system (like a rules engine) to actuate on a device?

## Getting data to the rules engine

By default, data is already passed from the core data service to application services (app services) via 0MQ message.  A preconfigured application service is provided with the EdgeX default Docker Compose files that gets this data and routes it to the [Kuiper rules engine](../microservices/support/Kuiper/Ch-Kuiper.md).  The application service is called `app-service-rules` (see below).  More specifically, it is an [app service configurable](../microservices/application/AppServiceConfigurable.md).

``` yaml
  app-service-rules:
    image: edgexfoundry/docker-app-service-configurable:1.2.0
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:48100:48100"
    container_name: edgex-app-service-configurable-rules
    hostname: edgex-app-service-configurable-rules
    networks:
      - edgex-network
    environment:
      <<: *common-variables
      edgex_profile: rules-engine
      Service_Host: edgex-app-service-configurable-rules
      Service_Port: 48100
      MessageBus_SubscribeHost_Host: edgex-core-data
      Binding_PublishTopic: events
    depends_on:
      - consul
#      - logging  # uncomment if re-enabled remote logging
      - data
```

### Seeing the data export

The log level of any EdgeX micro service is set to `INFO` by default.  If you tune the log level of the app-service-rules micro service to `DEBUG`, you can see `Event`s pass through the app service on the way to the rules engine.

#### Set the log level

To set the log level of any service, open the [Consul UI](../microservices/configuration/Ch-Configuration.md#web-user-interface) in a browser by visiting `http://[host]:8500`.  When the Consul UI opens, click on the Key/Value tab on the top of the screen.

On the Key/Value display page, click on `edgex` > `appservices` > `1.0` > `AppService-rules-engine` > `Writable` > `LogLevel`.  In the Value entry field that presents itself, replace `INFO` with `DEBUG` and hit the `Save` button.

#### View the service log

The log level change will be picked up by the application service.  In a terminal window, execute the Docker command below to view the service log.

``` shell
docker logs -f edgex-app-service-configurable-rules
```

Now push another event/reading into core data as you did earlier (see [Send Event](./Ch-WalkthroughReading.md#walkthrough-send-event)).  You should see each new event/reading created by acknowledged by the app service.  With the right application service and rules engine configuration, the event/reading data is sent to the rules engine where it can then be used to trigger commands just as you did manually in this walkthrough.

## Exporting data to anywhere

You can create an additional application service to get the data to another application or service, REST endpoint, MQTT topic, cloud provider, and more.  See the [Getting Started guide](../getting-started/quick-start/index.md#exporting-data) on exporting data for more information on how to use another app service configurable to get EdgeX data to any client.


## Building your own solutions

Congratulations, you've made it all the way through the Walkthrough
