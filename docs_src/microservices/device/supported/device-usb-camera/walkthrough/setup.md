# Setup
Follow this guide to set up your system to run the USB Device Service.

## System Requirements

- Intel&#8482; Core&#174; processor
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- USB-compliant Camera

## Dependencies
The software has dependencies, including Git, Docker, Docker Compose, and assorted tools. Follow the instructions from the following link to install any dependency that are not already installed. 


### Install Git
Install Git from the official repository as documented on the [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) site.

1. Update installation repositories:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

2. Add the Git repository:
    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa -y
    ```

3. Install Git:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install git
    ```

### Install Docker
Install Docker from the official repository as documented on the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) site.

### Verify Docker
To enable running Docker commands without the preface of sudo, add the user to the Docker group. Then run Docker with the `hello-world` test.

1. Create Docker group:
    ```bash
    sudo groupadd docker
    ```

    !!! Note 
        If the group already exists, `groupadd` outputs a message: `groupadd: group docker already exists`. This is OK.

2. Add User to group:
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```

3. Please logout or reboot for the changes to take effect.

4. To verify the Docker installation, run `hello-world`:

    ```bash
    docker run hello-world
    ```

    A **Hello from Docker!** greeting indicates successful installation.

    ```bash
    Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
    latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
    2db29710123e: Pull complete 
    Digest: sha256:10d7d58d5ebd2a652f4d93fdd86da8f265f5318c6a73cc5b6a9798ff6d2b2e67
    Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
    ...
    ```

### Install Docker Compose
Install Docker compose from the official repository as documented on the [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) site.

### Install Tools
Install the build, media streaming, and parsing tools:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install build-essential jq curl v4l-utils mplayer
    ```

!!! Note 
    The device service ONLY works on Linux with kernel v5.10 or higher.  


The table below lists command line tools this guide uses to help with EdgeX configuration and device setup.

| Tool        | Description | Note |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| **build-essential** |  Developer tools such as libc, gcc, g++ and make. | |
| **jq**   |Parses the JSON object returned from the `curl` requests. |The `jq` command includes parameters that are used to parse and format data. In this tutorial, the `jq` command has been configured to return and format appropriate data for each `curl` command that is piped into it. |
| **curl**     | Allows the user to connect to services such as EdgeX. |Use curl to get transfer information either to or from this service. In the tutorial, use `curl` to communicate with the EdgeX API. The call will return a JSON object.|
| **v4l-utils** | USB camera utility tools | This will be used to determine camera paths on the system for manual addition of cameras. |
| **mplayer** | Video player | Use this to view the camera stream. |
