# Deployment
Follow this guide to deploy and run the service.

=== "Docker"

    1. Navigate to the Edgex compose directory.

        ```shell
        cd ~/edgex/edgex-compose/compose-builder
        ```
    
    2. Checkout the latest release ({{version}}):

        ```shell
        git checkout {{version}}
        ```

    3. Run EdgeX with the USB microservice in secure or non-secure mode:  

        ##### Non-secure mode

        ```shell
        make run no-secty ds-usb-camera
        ```

        ##### Secure mode 

        !!! note
            Recommended for secure and production level deployments. 

        ```shell
        make run ds-usb-camera
        ```

=== "Native"

    1. Navigate to the Edgex compose directory.

        ```shell
        cd ~/edgex/edgex-compose/compose-builder
        ```
    
    2. Checkout the latest release ({{version}}):

        ```shell
        git checkout {{version}}
        ```
    
    3. Run EdgeX:

        ```shell
        make run no-secty
        ```

    4. Navigate out of the `edgex-compose` directory to the `device-usb-camera` directory:
    
         ```shell
         cd device-usb-camera
         ```

    5. Checkout the latest release ({{version}}):

        ```shell
        git checkout {{version}}
        ```

    6. Build the executable  

        ```shell
        make build
        ```

        <details>
            <summary>[Optional] Build with NATS Messaging</summary>
            Currently, the NATS Messaging capability (NATS MessageBus) is opt-in at build time. To build using NATS, run make build-nats:
            ```bash
            make build-nats
            ```    
        </details>

    7. Deploy the service
        ```
        cd cmd && EDGEX_SECURITY_SECRET_STORE=false ./device-usb-camera
        ```

## Verify Service, Device Profiles, and Device

1. Check the status of the container:

    ```bash 
    docker ps -f name=device-usb-camera
    ```

    The status column will indicate if the container is running and how long it has been up.

    Example Output:

    ```docker
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                         COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS          PORTS                                                                                         NAMES
    f0a1c646f324   edgexfoundry/device-usb-camera:0.0.0-dev                        "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   26 hours ago   Up 20 hours   127.0.0.1:8554->8554/tcp, 127.0.0.1:59983->59983/tcp                         edgex-device-usb-camera                                                                   edgex-device-onvif-camera
    ```

1. Check that the device service is added to EdgeX:

    ```bash
    curl -s http://localhost:59881/api/{{api_version}}/deviceservice/name/device-usb-camera | jq .
    ```

    Successful:
    ```json
    {
        "apiVersion" : "{{api_version}}",
        "statusCode": 200,
        "service": {
            "created": 1658769423192,
            "modified": 1658872893286,
            "id": "04470def-7b5b-4362-9958-bc5ff9f54f1e",
            "name": "device-usb-camera",
            "baseAddress": "http://edgex-device-usb-camera:59983",
            "adminState": "UNLOCKED"
        }
    }
    ```
    Unsuccessful:
    ```json
    {
        "apiVersion" : "{{api_version}}",
        "message": "fail to query device service by name device-usb-camera",
        "statusCode": 404
    }
    ```                              
 
1. Verify device(s) have been successfully added to core-metadata.

    ```bash
    curl -s http://localhost:59881/api/{{api_version}}/device/all | jq -r '"deviceName: " + '.devices[].name''
    ```

    Example Output: 
    ```bash
    deviceName: NexiGo_N930AF_FHD_Webcam_NexiG-20201217010
    ```
    
    !!! Note 
        The `jq -r` option is used to reduce the size of the displayed response. The entire device with all information can be seen by removing `-r '"deviceName: " + '.devices[].name'', and replacing it with '.'`

## Add credentials for the rtsp stream.

!!! note
    If you want to disable rtsp authentication entirely, you must [build a custom image](../walkthrough/custom-build.md).

=== "Non-secure Mode" 
    1. Enter your chosen username and password into this command, and then execute it to set the insecure secrets.
    !!! example - "Example credential command"
            ```bash
            curl --data '{
                "apiVersion" : "{{api_version}}",
                "secretName": "rtspauth",
                "secretData":[
                    {
                        "key":"username",
                        "value":"<pick-a-username>"
                    },
                    {
                        "key":"password",
                        "value":"<pick-a-secure-password>"
                    }
                ]
            }' -X POST http://localhost:59983/api/{{api_version}}/secret
            ```
=== "Secure Mode"  
    1. Navigate to the `edgex-compose/compose-builder` directory.
    1. Generate a JWT token
        ```bash
        make get-token
        ```
    1. Enter your chosen username and password, and the generated JWT into this command, and then execute it to set the secure secrets.
    !!! example - "Example credential command"
        ```bash
        curl --data '{
            "apiVersion" : "{{api_version}}",
            "secretName": "rtspauth",
            "secretData":[
                {
                    "key":"username",
                    "value":"<pick-a-username>"
                },
                {
                    "key":"password",
                    "value":"<pick-a-secure-password>"
                }
            ]
        }' -H Authorization:Bearer "<enter your JWT token here (make get-token)>" -X POST http://localhost:59983/api/{{api_version}}/secret
        ```


## Manage Devices

!!! Warning 
    This section only needs to be performed if discovery is disabled. Discovery is enabled by default.

Devices can either be added to the service by defining them in a static configuration file, discovering devices dynamically, or with the REST API. For this example, the device will be added using the REST API.

1. Run the following command to determine the `Path` to the usb camera for video streaming:
    ```bash
    v4l2-ctl --list-devices
    ```

    The output should look similar to this:
    ```
    NexiGo N930AF FHD Webcam: NexiG (usb-0000:00:14.0-1):
        /dev/video6
        /dev/video7
        /dev/media2
    ```

    For this example, the `Path` is `/dev/video6`.


1. Edit the information to appropriately match the camera. The device's protocol properties contain:
   * `name` is the name of the device. For this example, the name is `Camera001`
   * `Path` is a file descriptor of camera created by the OS. Use the `Path` determined in the previous step.
   * `AutoStreaming` indicates whether the device service should automatically start video streaming for cameras. Default value is false.
   
    !!! example - "Example Command"
        ```bash
        curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
        http://localhost:59881/api/{{api_version}}/device \
        -d '[
            {
            "apiVersion" : "{{api_version}}",
            "device": {
                "name": "Camera001",
                "serviceName": "device-usb-camera",
                "profileName": "USB-Camera-General",
                "description": "My test camera",
                "adminState": "UNLOCKED",
                "operatingState": "UP",
                "protocols": {
                    "USB": {
                    "CardName": "NexiGo N930AF FHD Webcam: NexiG",
                    "Path": "/dev/video6",
                    "AutoStreaming": "false"
                    }
                }
            }
            }
        ]'
        ```

    Example Output: 
    ```bash
    [{"apiVersion" : "{{api_version}}","statusCode":201,"id":"fb5fb7f2-768b-4298-a916-d4779523c6b5"}]
    ```
