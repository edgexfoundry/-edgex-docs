# Setup

Follow this guide to set up your system to run the ONVIF Device Service.

## System Requirements

- Intel&#8482; Core&#174; processor
- Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS or later
- ONVIF-compliant Camera

!!!NOTE 
      The instructions in this guide were developed and tested using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and the Tapo C200 Pan/Tilt Wi-Fi Camera, referred to throughout this document as the **Tapo C200 Camera**. However, the software may work with other Linux distributions and ONVIF-compliant cameras. Refer to our [list of tested cameras for more information](../supplementary-info/ONVIF-protocol.md#tested-onvif-cameras)

**Other Requirements**

You must have administrator (sudo) privileges to execute the user guide commands.

## Dependencies
The software has dependencies, including Git, Docker, Docker Compose, and assorted tools. Follow the instructions below to install any dependency that is not already installed. 

### Install Git
Install Git from the official repository as documented on the [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) site.

1. Update installation repositories:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Add the Git repository:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa -y
   ```

3. Install Git:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install git
   ```

### Install Docker
Install Docker from the official repository as documented on the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) site.

### Verify Docker
To enable running Docker commands without the preface of sudo, add the user to the Docker group. Then run Docker with the `hello-world` test.

1. Create Docker group:
   ```bash
   sudo groupadd docker
   ```

      <div class="admonition note">
         <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
         <p>If the group already exists, `groupadd` outputs a message: **groupadd: group `docker` already exists**. This is OK.</p>
      </div>
      
1. Add User to group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

1. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

1. To verify the Docker installation, run <code>hello-world</code>:
      ```bash
      docker run hello-world
      ```
      A <strong>Hello from Docker!</strong> greeting indicates successful installation.

      ```bash
      Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
      latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
      2db29710123e: Pull complete 
      Digest: sha256:10d7d58d5ebd2a652f4d93fdd86da8f265f5318c6a73cc5b6a9798ff6d2b2e67
      Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

      Hello from Docker!
      This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
      ...
      ```


### Install Docker Compose
Install Docker Compose from the official repository as documented on the [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-using-the-repository) site.

### Install Tools
Install the build, media streaming, and parsing tools:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential ffmpeg jq curl
```

### Tool Descriptions
The table below lists command line tools this guide uses to help with EdgeX configuration and device setup.

| Tool        | Description | Note |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| **curl**     | Allows the user to connect to services such as EdgeX. |Use curl to get transfer information either to or from this service. In the tutorial, use `curl` to communicate with the EdgeX API. The call will return a JSON object.|
| **jq**   |Parses the JSON object returned from the `curl` requests. |The `jq` command includes parameters that are used to parse and format data. In this tutorial, the `jq` command has been configured to return and format appropriate data for each `curl` command that is piped into it. |
| **base64**   | Converts data into the Base64 format.| |
