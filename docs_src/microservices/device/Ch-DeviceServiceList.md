| [device-gpio]( https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-gpio/tree/{{version}})                 | GPIO | Active | Linux only; uses sysfs ABI | |
| [device-bacnet-c]( https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-bacnet-c/tree/{{version}})         | BACnet | Active | Supports BACnet via ethernet (IP) or serial (MSTP).  Uses the Steve Karag BACnet stack | |
| [device-coap-c]( https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-coap-c/tree/{{version}})             | CoAP | Active | This service is in the process of being redeveloped and expanded for upcoming release for Kamakura â€“ and will support Thread as a subset of functionality.  Currently supports CoAP-based REST and is one way communications (read-only) | |
| [device-uart]( https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-uart/tree/{{version}})                 | UART |Active| Linux only; for connecting serial UART devices to EdgeX | |

!!! note
    Check the above Device Service README(s) for known devices that have been tested with the Device Service. Not all Device Service READMEs will have this information.
