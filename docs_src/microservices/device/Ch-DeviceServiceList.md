# Supported Device Services

The following table lists the EdgeX device services and protocols they support.

| Device Service Repository | Protocol | Status | Comments |
|---------------------------|----------|--------|----------|
| [device-onvif-camera](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-onvif-camera/tree/v2.2.0) | ONVIF | Active | Full implementation of ONVIF spec. Note that not all cameras implement the complete ONVIF spec. |
| [device-usb-camera](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-usb-camera/tree/v2.2.0) | USB | Active | USB using V4L2 API. ONLY works on Linux with kernel v5.10 or higher. Includes RTSP server for video streaming. |
| [device-camera-go]( https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-camera-go/tree/v2.2.0) | ONVIF | **Deprecated** | **Deprecated - use the new Device ONVIF Camera service** |
| [device-rest-go]( https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-rest-go/tree/v2.2.0) | REST | Active| provides one-way communications only.  Allows posting of binary and JSON data via REST.  Events are single reading only.|
| [device-rfid-llrp-go]( https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-rfid-llrp-go/tree/v2.2.0) | LLRP | Active| Communications with RFID readers via LLRP. |
| [device-snmp-go]( https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-snmp-go/tree/v2.2.0) | SNMP | Active| Basic implementation of SNMP protocol.  Async callbacks and traps not currently supported. |
| [device-virtual-go]( https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-virtual-go/tree/v2.2.0) | | Active| Simulates sensor readings of type binary, Boolean, float, integer and unsigned integer |
| [device-mqtt-go]( https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-mqtt-go/tree/v2.2.0) | MQTT | Active |  Two way communications via multiple MQTT topics |
| [device-modbus-go]( https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-modbus-go/tree/v2.2.0) | Modbus | Active | Supports Modbus over TCP or RTU |
| [device-gpio]( https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-gpio/tree/v2.2.0) | GPIO | Active | Linux only; uses sysfs ABI |
| [device-grove-c](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-grove-c/tree/v1.3.1) | | **2.x TBD** | Connects the Grove sensor on Grove Raspberry Pi using libmraa library; Linux and ARM only |
| [device-bacnet-c]( https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-bacnet-c/tree/v1.3.1) | BACnet | **2.x TBD** | Supports BACnet via ethernet (IP) or serial (MSTP).  Uses the Steve Karag BACnet stack |
| [device-coap-c]( https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-coap-c/tree/v2.1.0) | CoAP | Active (**2.2.0 TBD**) | This service is in the process of being redeveloped and expanded for upcoming release for Kamakura â€“ and will support Thread as a subset of functionality.  Currently supports CoAP-based REST and is one way communications (read-only) |
| [device-uart]( https://github.com/edgexfoundry-holding/device-uart) | UART | **in Development** | Linux only; for connecting serial UART devices to EdgeX |
