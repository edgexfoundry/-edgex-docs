# Device GPIO - Protocol Properties

This device service does not define any device specific protocol properties. Any protocol properties specified in the Device Definition are ignored.
The GPIO protocol specifics are specified in the `attributes` for each resource in the Device Profile. See [Example Resource](./GettingStarted.md#direction-setting-with-sysfs) in walk-thru section for more details.
