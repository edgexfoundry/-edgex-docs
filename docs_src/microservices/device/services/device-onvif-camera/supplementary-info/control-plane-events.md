# Control Plane Events

## Introduction
Control plane events have been added to enable the Core Metadata to emit events onto the message bus when a device has been added, updated, or deleted.

Refer [Device System Events](../../../../core/metadata/details/DeviceSystemEvents.md) for more information.
