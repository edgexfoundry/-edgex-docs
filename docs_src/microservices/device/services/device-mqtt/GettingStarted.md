# Device MQTT - Getting Started

## Overview

Device MQTT is a device service for connecting a device or sensor feed to EdgeX using an MQTT topic.

## Running Services with Device MQTT

The simplest way to run all the required services is to use the [Compose Builder](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-compose/tree/{{edgexversion}}/compose-builder) tool from a terminal window.

1. Clone [https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-compose/tree/{{edgexversion}}](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-compose/tree/{{edgexversion}})

2. Change to the **compose-builder** folder

3. Run the services
    ```
    make run ds-mqtt mqtt-broker no-secty ui
    ```
This runs, in non-secure mode, all the standard EdgeX services, along with a mqtt message broker, device MQTT, and the EdgeX UI.
