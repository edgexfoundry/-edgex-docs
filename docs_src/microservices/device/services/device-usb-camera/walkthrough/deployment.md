# Deployment
Follow this guide to deploy and run the service.

=== "Docker"

    1. Navigate to the Edgex compose directory.

        ```shell
        cd edgex-compose/compose-builder
        ```

    2. Checkout the latest release ({{edgexversion}}):

        ```shell
        git checkout {{edgexversion}}
        ```
    
    3. Run EdgeX with the USB microservice in secure or non-secure mode:  

        ##### Non-secure mode

        ```shell
        make run ds-usb-camera no-secty
        ```

        ##### Secure mode 

        !!! note
            Recommended for secure and production level deployments. 

        ```shell
        make run ds-usb-camera
        ```

        ### Token Generation (secure mode only)
        !!! note
            Need to wait for sometime for the services to be fully up before executing the next set of commands.
            Securely store Consul ACL token and the JWT token generated which are needed to map credentials and execute apis.
            It is not recommended to store these secrets in cleartext in your machine.

        !!! note
            The JWT token expires after 119 minutes, and you will need to generate a new one.
        
        Generate the Consul ACL Token. Use the token generated anywhere you see `<consul-token>` in the documentation.
        ```bash
        make get-consul-acl-token
        ```
        Example output:
        ```bash
        12345678-abcd-1234-abcd-123456789abc
        ```

        Generate the JWT Token. Use the token generated anywhere you see `<jwt-token>` in the documentation.
        ```bash
        make get-token
        ```
        Example output:
        `eyJhbGciOiJFUzM4NCIsImtpZCI6IjUyNzM1NWU4LTQ0OWYtNDhhZC05ZGIwLTM4NTJjOTYxMjA4ZiJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJlZGdleCIsImV4cCI6MTY4NDk2MDI0MSwiaWF0IjoxNjg0OTU2NjQxLCJpc3MiOiIvdjEvaWRlbnRpdHkvb2lkYyIsIm5hbWUiOiJlZGdleHVzZXIiLCJuYW1lc3BhY2UiOiJyb290Iiwic3ViIjoiMGRjNThlNDMtNzBlNS1kMzRjLWIxM2QtZTkxNDM2ODQ5NWU0In0.oa8Fac9aXPptVmHVZ2vjymG4pIvF9R9PIzHrT3dAU11fepRi_rm7tSeq_VvBUOFDT_JHwxDngK1VqBVLRoYWtGSA2ewFtFjEJRj-l83Vz33KySy0rHteJIgVFVi1V7q5`

        !!! note
            Secrets such as passwords, certificates, tokens and more in Edgex are stored in a secret store which is implemented using Vault a product of Hashicorp.
            Vault supports security features allowing for the issuing of consul tokens. JWT token is required for the API Gateway which is a trust boundry for Edgex services.
            It allows for external clients to be verified when issuing REST requests to the microservices. 
            For more info refer [Secure Consul](../../../../../security/Ch-Secure-Consul.md), [API Gateway](../../../../../security/Ch-APIGateway.md) 
            and [Edgex Security](../../../../../security/Ch-Security.md).
            

=== "Native"
   
    1. Navigate to the Edgex compose directory.

        ```shell
        cd edgex-compose/compose-builder
        ```
    
    2. Checkout the latest release ({{edgexversion}}):

        ```shell
        git checkout {{edgexversion}}
        ```

    3. Run EdgeX:

        ```shell
        make run no-secty
        ```

    4. Navigate out of the `edgex-compose` directory to the `device-usb-camera` directory:
    
         ```shell
         cd device-usb-camera
         ```

    5. Checkout the latest release ({{edgexversion}}):

        ```shell
        git checkout {{edgexversion}}
        ```

    6. Build the executable  
        ```shell
        make build
        ```

        <details>
            <summary>[Optional] Build with NATS Messaging</summary>
            Currently, the NATS Messaging capability (NATS MessageBus) is opt-in at build time. To build using NATS, run make build-nats:
            ```bash
            make build-nats
            ```    
        </details>

    7. Deploy the service
        ```
        cd cmd && EDGEX_SECURITY_SECRET_STORE=false ./device-usb-camera
        ```

## Verify Service, Device Profiles, and Device

1. Check the status of the container:

    ```bash 
    docker ps -f name=device-usb-camera
    ```

    The status column will indicate if the container is running and how long it has been up.

    Example output:

    ```docker
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                         COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS          PORTS                                                                                         NAMES
    f0a1c646f324   edgexfoundry/device-usb-camera:0.0.0-dev                        "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   26 hours ago   Up 20 hours   127.0.0.1:8554->8554/tcp, 127.0.0.1:59983->59983/tcp                         edgex-device-usb-camera                                                                   edgex-device-onvif-camera
    ```

1. Check whether the device service is added to EdgeX:

    !!! note
        If running in secure mode all the api executions need the JWT token generated previously. E.g.
        ```bash
        curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:59881/api/{{api_version}}/deviceservice/name/device-usb-camera' \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>' \
        --data-raw ''
        ```

    ```bash
    curl -s http://localhost:59881/api/{{api_version}}/deviceservice/name/device-usb-camera | jq .
    ```

    Successful:
    ```json
    {
        "apiVersion" : "{{api_version}}",
        "statusCode": 200,
        "service": {
            "created": 1658769423192,
            "modified": 1658872893286,
            "id": "04470def-7b5b-4362-9958-bc5ff9f54f1e",
            "name": "device-usb-camera",
            "baseAddress": "http://edgex-device-usb-camera:59983",
            "adminState": "UNLOCKED"
        }
    }
    ```
    Unsuccessful:
    ```json
    {
        "apiVersion" : "{{api_version}}",
        "message": "fail to query device service by name device-usb-camera",
        "statusCode": 404
    }
    ```                              
 
1. Verify device(s) have been successfully added to core-metadata.

    ```bash
    curl -s http://localhost:59881/api/{{api_version}}/device/all | jq -r '"deviceName: " + '.devices[].name''
    ```

    Example output: 
    ```bash
    deviceName: NexiGo_N930AF_FHD_Webcam_NexiG-20201217010
    ```
    
    !!! Note 
        The `jq -r` option is used to reduce the size of the displayed response. The entire device with all information can be seen by removing `-r '"deviceName: " + '.devices[].name'', and replacing it with '.'`

    !!! note
        If running in secure mode this command needs the [Consul ACL token](#token-generation-secure-mode-only) generated previously.

    ```bash
    curl -H "X-Consul-Token:<consul-token>" -X GET "http://localhost:8500/v1/kv/edgex/{{api_version}}/device-usb-camera?keys=true"
    ``` 

## Add credentials for the rtsp stream.

!!! note
    If you want to disable rtsp authentication entirely, you must [build a custom image](../walkthrough/custom-build.md).

=== "Non-secure Mode" 
    1. Enter your chosen username and password into this command, and then execute it to set the insecure secrets.
    !!! example - "Example credential command"
            ```bash
            curl --data '{
                "apiVersion" : "{{api_version}}",
                "secretName": "rtspauth",
                "secretData":[
                    {
                        "key":"username",
                        "value":"<pick-a-username>"
                    },
                    {
                        "key":"password",
                        "value":"<pick-a-secure-password>"
                    }
                ]
            }' -X POST http://localhost:59983/api/{{api_version}}/secret
            ```
=== "Secure Mode"  
    1. Navigate to the `edgex-compose/compose-builder` directory.
    1. Generate a JWT token
        ```bash
        make get-token
        ```
    1. Enter your chosen username and password, and the generated JWT into this command, and then execute it to set the secure secrets.
    !!! example - "Example credential command"
        ```bash
        curl --data '{
            "apiVersion" : "{{api_version}}",
            "secretName": "rtspauth",
            "secretData":[
                {
                    "key":"username",
                    "value":"<pick-a-username>"
                },
                {
                    "key":"password",
                    "value":"<pick-a-secure-password>"
                }
            ]
        }' -H Authorization:Bearer "<enter your JWT token here (make get-token)>" -X POST http://localhost:59983/api/{{api_version}}/secret
        ```


## Manage Devices

!!! Warning 
    This section only needs to be performed if discovery is disabled. Discovery is enabled by default.

Devices can either be added to the service by defining them in a static configuration file, discovering devices dynamically, or with the REST API. For this example, the device will be added using the REST API.

1. Run the following command to determine the `Path` to the usb camera for video streaming:
    ```bash
    v4l2-ctl --list-devices
    ```

    The output should look similar to this:
    ```
    NexiGo N930AF FHD Webcam: NexiG (usb-0000:00:14.0-1):
        /dev/video6
        /dev/video7
        /dev/media2
    ```

    For this example, the `Path` is `/dev/video6`.


1. Edit the information to appropriately match the camera. Find more information about the device protocol properties [here](../supplementary-info/USB-protocol.md#usb-protocol-properties).
   
    !!! example - "Example Command"
        ```bash
        curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
        http://localhost:59881/api/{{api_version}}/device \
        -d '[
            {
            "apiVersion" : "{{api_version}}",
            "device": {
                "name": "Camera001",
                "serviceName": "device-usb-camera",
                "profileName": "USB-Camera-General",
                "description": "My test camera",
                "adminState": "UNLOCKED",
                "operatingState": "UP",
                "protocols": {
                    "USB": {
                    "CardName": "NexiGo N930AF FHD Webcam: NexiG",
                    "Paths": ["/dev/video6",],
                    "AutoStreaming": "false"
                    }
                }
            }
            }
        ]'
        ```

    Example output: 
    ```bash
    [{"apiVersion" : "{{api_version}}","statusCode":201,"id":"fb5fb7f2-768b-4298-a916-d4779523c6b5"}]
    ```
