# Device Service - Environment Variables

See the [Common Environment Variables](../../configuration/CommonEnvironmentVariables.md) section for the list of environment variables common to all EdgeX Services. The remaining in this section are specific to Device Service.

### EDGEX_INSTANCE_NAME

This environment variable overrides the [`-i/--instance` command-line option](CommandLine.md#running-multiple-instances) and the default set by the device service.
