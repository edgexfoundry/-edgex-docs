# Application Service Configuration

Similar to other EdgeX services, configuration is first determined by the `configuration.toml` file in the `/res` folder. Once loaded any environment overrides are applied. If `-cp` is passed to the application on startup, the SDK will leverage the specific configuration provider (i.e Consul) to push the configuration into the provider and monitor `Writeable` configuration from there. You will find the configuration under the `edgex/appservices/2.0/` key in the provider (i.e Consul). On re-restart the service will pull the configuration from the provider and apply any environment overrides.

This section describes the configuration elements that are unique to Application Services

Please first refer to the general [Configuration documentation](../../configuration/CommonConfiguration) for configuration properties common across all EdgeX services.

!!! note
    `*`indicates the configuration value can be changed on the fly if using a configuration provider (like Consul).
    `**`indicates the configuration value can be changed but the service must be restarted.

## Writable
The following are additional entries in the **Writable** section which are applicable to Application Services.

### Writable StoreAndForward
The section configures the **Store and Forward** capability. Please refer to [Store and Forward](../ApplicationFunctionsSDK/#store-and-forward) documentation for more details.

| Configuration | Default Value |                                                              |
| :------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Enabled       | false*        | Indicates whether the **Store and Forward** capability enabled or disabled |
| RetryInterval | "5m"*         | Indicates the duration of time to wait before retries, aka *Forward* |
| MaxRetryCount | 10*           | Indicates whether maximum number of retries of failed data. The failed data is removed after the maximum retries has been exceeded. A value of `0` indicates endless retries. |

### Writable Pipeline
The section configures the Configurable Function Pipeline which is used only by App Service Configurable. Please refer to [App Service Configurable - Getting Started](../AppServiceConfigurable/#getting-started) section for more details

### Writable InsecureSecrets
This section defines Insecure Secrets that are used when running in non-secure mode, i.e. when Vault isn't available. This is a dynamic map of configuration, so can empty if no secrets are used or can have as many or few user define secrets. It simulates a Secret Store in non-secure mode. Below are a few examples that are need if using the indicated capabilities.

|Configuration  |     Default Value     | Description |
| --- | --- | -- |
| **DB** | --- | This section defines a block of insecure secrets for database credentials when **Redis** is used for the MessageBus and/or when **Store and Forward** is enabled and running is non-secure mode. This section is not required if **Store and Forward** is not enabled and not using **Redis** for the MessageBus . |
| path | redisdb* | Indicates the location in the simulated Secret Store where the DB secret resides. |
| **DB Secrets** | --- | This section is the collection of **DB** secret data |

| headervalue | undefined* | This indicates the name of the secret value to use as the value in the HTTP header. |
| **mqtt** | --- | This section defines a block of insecure secrets for MQTT export, i.e. `MQTTSecretSend` function. |
| path | mqtt* | Indicates the location in the simulated Secret Store where the MQTT secret reside. |
| **mqtt Secrets** | --- | This section is the collection of MQTT secret data. See [Mqtt Export](BuiltIn.md#mqtt) documentation for more details on use of secret data. |
| username | blank* | Indicates the value for the `username` when connecting to the MQTT broker using ` usernamepassword` authentication mode. Must be configured to the value the MQTT broker is expecting. |
| password | blank* | Indicates the value for the `password` when connecting to the MQTT broker using ` usernamepassword` authentication mode. Must be configured to the value the MQTT broker is expecting. |

!!! note
    `external-mqtt` is not the default Trigger type, so there are no default values for `ExternalMqtt` settings beyond those that the Go compiler gives to the empty struct. Some of those default values are not valid and must be specified, i.e. `Authmode`

### Application Settings 

`[ApplicationSettings]` - Is used for custom application settings and is accessed via the ApplicationSettings() API. The ApplicationSettings API returns a `map[string] string` containing the contents on the ApplicationSetting section of the `configuration.toml` file.

```toml
 [ApplicationSettings]
 ApplicationName = "My Application Service"
```

### Custom Structured Configuration

!!! edgey "EdgeX 2.0"
    New for EdgeX 2.0

Custom Application Services can now define their own custom structured configuration section in the `configuration.toml` file. Any additional sections in the TOML are ignore by the SDK when it parses the file for the SDK defined sections. See the [Custom Configuration](ApplicationFunctionsSDK.md#custom-configuration) section of the SDK documentation for more details.
