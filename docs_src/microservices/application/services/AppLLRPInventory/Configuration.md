# App RFID LLRP Inventory - Configuration

This application service has the following custom configuration

## AppCustom

This section contains the `Aliases` configuration map which maps reader/antenna combinations to meaningful location names. 
The map is initially empty and is up to the deployment to populate it.
See [Location Aliases](./details/LocationAliases.md) for complete details

## ApplicationSettings

This section contains the following settings:

| Name                         | Default Value    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| DeviceServiceName            | device-rfid-llrp | Name of the device service that manages the list LLRP Readers. Should never change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| AdjustLastReadOnByOrigin     | true             | If `true`, will override the tag read timestamps sent from the sensor  with an adjusted one based on the UTC time the `LLRP Device Service` received the message from the device (aka `Origin`). Essentially all timestamps will be shifted by the difference in time from when the sensor says it was read versus when it  was actually received. This option attempts to account for message latency and time drift between sensors by standardizing  all timestamps. If `false`, timestamps will retain their original values sent from the sensor. |
| DepartedThresholdSeconds     | 600              | How long in seconds a tag should not be read before it will generate a `Departed` event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| DepartedCheckIntervalSeconds | 30               | How often to run the background task that checks if a Tag needs  to be marked `Departed`. Smaller intervals will cause more frequent checks and less variability at the expense of CPU utilization and lock contention. Larger intervals on the other hand may cause greater latency  between when a tag passes the `DepartedThresholdSeconds` and when the `Departed` event is actually generated (waiting for the next check to occur).                                                                                                              |
| AgeOutHours                  | 336              | How long in hours to keep `Departed` tags in our in-memory inventory before they  are aged-out (purged). This is done for CPU and RAM conservation in deployments with a large turnover of unique tags. An aged-out tag will be purged from memory and if it is read again it will be treated as the first time seeing that tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| MobilityProfileThreshold     | 6.0              | RSSI threshold that must be exceeded for the tag to move from the previous sensor. Units are `dBm`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| MobilityProfileHoldoffMillis | 500.0            | Amount of time in which the offset used is equal to the threshold, effectively the slope is not used. Units are `milliseconds`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| MobilityProfileSlope         | -0.008           | Used to determine the offset applied to older RSSI values (aka rate of decay). Units are `dBm per millisecond`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
