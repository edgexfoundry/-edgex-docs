# App RFID LLRP Inventory - Purpose

This service produces inventory **(Arrived, Moved, Departed)** events from the raw LLRP tag readings produced by the [RFID LLRP Device Service](../../../device/services/device-rfid-llrp.md). It also configures and manages LLRP readers via commands to the [RFID LLRP Device Service](../../../device/services/device-rfid-llrp.md).
