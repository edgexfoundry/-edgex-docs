# App Service Configurable - Purpose

The purpose of App Service Configurable is to provide an easy way to get started with processing data flowing through EdgeX.
This service leverages the [App Functions SDK](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go) and provides a way for
developers to use configuration instead of code to utilize the built-in pipeline functions from the SDK.
Please refer to [Available Configurable Pipeline Functions](../details/AvailablePipelineFunctions)  section below for
full list of built-in functions that can be used in the configurable pipeline.
