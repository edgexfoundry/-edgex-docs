# App Functions SDK - Purpose

Welcome the App Functions SDK for EdgeX. This SDK is meant to provide all the plumbing necessary for developers to get started in processing/transforming/exporting edge data. 

Use this SDK to create a custom application service when you have data processing needs that are not satisfied by the [Built-In Pipeline Functions](api/BuiltInPipelineFunctions.md). If these functions do satisfy your needs, then check out [App Service Configurable.](../services/AppServiceConfigurable/Purpose.md)
