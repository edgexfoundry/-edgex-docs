# Core Data - Data Retention and Persistent Caps

!!! edgey "EdgeX 3.1"
    New in EdgeX 3.1

!!! note
    This feature is for both Core Data and Support Notifications service.

## Overview

### Core Data service
In use cases, since core data persists data in the local database indefinitely, there is a need to persist the latest recent readings only and clean up the old ones, as keeping an infinite number of readings is considered computationally expensive and can lead to a lack of machine memory. Thus, a retention mechanism is placed on core data to keep a certain number of readings.

Under this mechanism, the maximum readings capacity is called <code>MaxCap</code> and the minimum readings capacity is called <code>MinCap</code>. Core data will create an internal schedule according to the <code>Interval</code> configuration to check if the number of readings are higher than the <code>MaxCap</code>. When the number of readings reach the <code>MaxCap</code>, Core data will purge the amount of the readings to the <code>MinCap</code>.

For example, the <code>MaxCap</code> is set to 10, the <code>MinCap</code> is set to 2 and the <code>Interval</code> is set to 3s. Now, core data will check how many readings are in the local database every 3 seconds. When the number of readings reach 10, core data will check the 3rd reading to find the related event's origin timestamp and perform function <code>DeleteEventsByAge</code> to delete events by age. This way the related readings will also be deleted.

## Introduction

For detailed information on the data retention see [Use Case for capping readings in Core Data](../../../../design/ucr/Core-Data-Retention.md).

## Prerequisite Knowledge

- For detailed information on the data retention see [Core Data Configuration Properties](../Configuration.md) and browse to **retention** tab.

- For detailed information on the data retention see [Notifications Configuration Properties](../../../support/notifications/Configuration.md#configuration-properties) and browse to **retention** tab.

## Enable Data Retention
Two ways to enable data retention mechanism:

- Using environment variables to override the default configuration
```yaml
RETENTION_ENABLED: true 
RETENTION_INTERVAL: <interval>  
RETENTION_MAXCAP: <maxcap>
RETENTION_MINCAP: <mincap>  
```

For detailed information about environment variables override see [Service Configuration Overrides](../../../configuration/CommonEnvironmentVariables.md#service-configuration-overrides).

!!! Note
    Consul will be deprecated in EdgeX 4.0, and core-keeper will become the new registry and configuration provider.
    
- Using <code>Consul</code> to override the default configuration
Open Consul web user interface and go to *Retention* section of the core-data or support-notification service to customize the configuarion.

For detailed information about Consul see [Configuration and Registry Provider](../../../configuration/ConfigurationAndRegistry.md#web-user-interface).
