# Support Scheduler

## Introduction

The support scheduler microservice provide an internal EdgeX “clock” that can kick off operations in any EdgeX service.  At a configuration specified time (called an **interval**), the service calls on any EdgeX service API URL via REST to trigger an operation (called an **interval action**).  For example, the scheduler service periodically calls on core data APIs to clean up old sensed events that have been successfully exported out of EdgeX.

!!! edgey "Edgex 2.0"
    For EdgeX 2.0 the REST API provided by the Support Scheduler has changed to use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for all responses and for all POST/PUT/PATCH requests. All query APIs (GET) which return multiple objects, such as /all, provide `offset` and `limit` query parameters. 

### Default Interval Actions

Scheduled interval actions configured by default with the reference implementation of the service include:

- Clean up of Core-data events/readings that have been persisted for an extended period. In order to prevent the edge node from running out of space, these old events/readings are removed. This is the "ScrubAged" operation. Scheduler parameters around this operation determine how often and where to call into Core-data to invoke this operation to expunge of old data.

---
**NOTE**
The removal of stale records occurs on a configurable schedule. By default, the default action above is invoked once a day at midnight.

---

### Scheduler Persistence

Support scheduler uses a data store to persist the Interval(s) and IntervalAction(s). Persistence is accomplished by the Scheduler DB located
in your current configured database for EdgeX.

---
**Info**
    Redis DB is used by default to persist all scheduler service information to include intervals and interval actions.

---
### ISO 8601 Standard

The times and frequencies defined in the scheduler service's intervals are specified using the [international date/time standard - ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).  So, for example, the start of an interval would be represented in YYYYMMDD'T'HHmmss format.  20180101T000000 represents January 1, 2018 at midnight.  Frequencies are represented with ISO 8601 durations. 

## Data Model
The latest developed data model will be updated in the [Swagger API document](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/EdgeXFoundry1/support-scheduler/2.3.0).

**NOTE**
Only RESTAddress is supported. The MQTTAddress may be implemented in a future release.

## Data Dictionary

=== "Intervals"
    |Property|Description|
    |---|---|
    ||An object defining a specific "period" in time|
    |Id|Uniquely identifies an interval, for example a UUID|

    |End|The end time of the given interval in ISO 8601 format|
    |Interval |How often the specific resource needs to be polled. It represents as a duration string. The format of this field is to be an unsigned integer followed by a unit which may be "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h" representing nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds, seconds, minutes or hours. Eg, "100ms", "24h"|

    |Modified|A timestamp indicating when the interval action was last modified|
    |Name |the name of the interval action|
    |Interval|associated interval that defines when the action occurs|
    |AdminState|interval action state - either LOCKED or UNLOCKED|
    |Content|The actual content to be sent as the body|
    |ContentType|Indicates which request contentType should be used (i.e. `text/html`, `application/json`), the default is `application/json`|   
=== "IntervalActions.Address"     
    |Property|Description|
    |---|---|
    ||An object inside `IntervalActions` indicating how to contact a specific endpoint by HTTP protocol|
    |Type|Currently only support `REST`|
    |Host|The host targeted by the action when it activates|
    |Port|The port on the targeted host|
    |HttpMethod|Indicates which Http verb should be used for the REST endpoint.(Only using when type is REST|
    |Path|The HTTP path at the targeted host for fulfillment of the action.(Only using when type is REST)|
