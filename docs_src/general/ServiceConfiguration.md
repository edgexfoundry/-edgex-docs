# Service Configuration

Each EdgeX micro service requires configuration (i.e. - a repository of initialization and operating values).  The configuration is initially provided by a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file but a service can utilize the centralized configuration management provided by EdgeX for its configuration. 

See the [Configuration and Registry documentation](../microservices/configuration/ConfigurationAndRegistry.md) for more details about initialization of services and the use of the configuration service.  

Please refer to the EdgeX Foundry [architectural decision record](../design/adr/0005-Service-Self-Config.md) for details (and design decisions) behind the configuration in EdgeX.

Please refer to the general [Common Configuration documentation](../microservices/configuration/CommonConfiguration.md) for configuration properties common to all services.  Find service specific configuration references in the tabs below.
