# App Service Examples

The following is a list of examples we currently have available that demonstrate various ways that the Application Functions SDK can be used. All of the examples
can be found in [https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-examples/tree/master/application-services](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-examples/tree/master/application-services). They focus on how to leverage various built in
provided functions as mentioned above as well as how to write your own in the case that the SDK does not provide what is needed.
