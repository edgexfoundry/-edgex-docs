# Creating an EdgeX Ubuntu Core Image

## Introduction
This guide walks you through creating an Ubuntu Core OS image that is preloaded with an EdgeX stack. We use [Ubuntu Core](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs) as the Linux distribution because it is optimized for IoT and is secure by design. We configure the image and bundle the current snapped versions of EdgeX components. After the deployment the snaps will continue to receive updates for the latest security and bug fixes (depending on the selected channel).

This guide is divided into three chapters to create:

- Ubuntu Core + EdgeX, with default configurations
- Ubuntu Core + EdgeX, with service configuration overrides
- Ubuntu Core + EdgeX, with custom service and device configuration files

Each chapter results in a working Ubuntu Core OS image that can be flashed on a disk and booted with the expected EdgeX stack.

In this example, we will create an `amd64` image, but the instructions can be adapted to other architectures and even for a Raspberry Pi. We will use the Device Virtual service to simulate devices and produce synthetic events.

!!! note
    This guide has been tested on an `amd64` **Ubuntu 22.04** as the desktop OS. It may work on other Linux distributions and Ubuntu versions.

    Some commands are executed on the desktop computer, but some others on the target Ubuntu Core system. For clarity, we use **ðŸ–¥ Desktop** and **ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core** titles for code blocks to distinguish where those commands are being executed.

    An Intel NUC11TNH with 8GB RAM and 250GB NAND flash storage has been used as the target `amd64` hardware. 

We use the following tools on the desktop machine:

- [snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/snapcraft) to manage keys in the store and build snaps
- [YQ](https://snapcraft.io/yq) to validate YAML files and convert them to JSON
- [ubuntu-image](https://snapcraft.io/ubuntu-image) v2 to build the Ubuntu Core image

Install them using the following commands:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
sudo snap install yq
sudo snap install ubuntu-image --classic --channel=2/stable
```

Before we start, it is a good idea to read through the following documents:

- [Inside Ubuntu Core](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/uc20/inside) to get familiar with the Ubuntu core internals
- [Getting Started using Snaps](../../getting-started/Ch-GettingStartedSnapUsers) to understand general EdgeX snap concepts

## A. Create an image with EdgeX components

In this chapter, we will create an OS image that includes the expected EdgeX components.

### Create an Ubuntu Core model assertion
The [model assertion](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/reference/assertions/model) is a digitally signed document that describes the content of the OS image.

Refer to [this article](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/custom-images#heading--signing) for details on how to sign the model assertion. Here are the needed steps:

1) Create a developer account

Follow the instructions [here](https://snapcraft.io/docs/creating-your-developer-account) to create a developer account, if you don't already have one.

2) Create and register a key

```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
snap login
snap keys
# continue if you have no existing keys
# you'll be asked to set a passphrase which is needed before signing
snap create-key edgex-demo
snapcraft register-key edgex-demo
```
We now have a registered key named `edgex-demo` which we'll use later.

3) Create the model assertion

First, make yourself familiar with the Ubuntu Core [model assertion](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/reference/assertions/model).

Find your developer ID using the Snapcraft CLI:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ snapcraft whoami
...
developer-id: <developer-id>
```
or from the [Snapcraft Dashboard](https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/dev/account/).

!!! info
    Unlike the official documentation which uses JSON, we use YAML serialization for the model. This is for consistency with all the other serialization formats in this tutorial. Moreover, it allows us to comment out some parts for testing or add comments to describe the details inline.


The [`pc` gadget](https://snapcraft.io/pc) is available as a prebuilt snap in the store, however, we need to build our own to extend the size of disk partitions to have sufficient capacity for our EdgeX snaps.

We will use the source code for Core22 AMD64 gadget from [here](https://github.com/snapcore/pc-amd64-gadget/tree/22) as basis.

Create `model.yaml` with the following content, replacing `authority-id`, `brand-id`, and `timestamp`:
```yaml
type: model
series: '16'

# set authority-id and brand-id your developer-id
authority-id: <developer-id>
brand-id: <developer-id>

model: ubuntu-core-22-amd64
architecture: amd64

# timestamp should be within your signature's validity period
timestamp: '2022-06-21T10:45:00+00:00'
base: core22

grade: dangerous

snaps:
  - name: pc
    type: gadget
    default-channel: 22/stable,
    id: UqFziVZDHLSyO3TqSWgNBoAdHbLI4dAH
  
  - name: pc-kernel
    type: kernel
    default-channel: 22/stable
    id: pYVQrBcKmBa0mZ4CCN7ExT6jH8rY1hza

  - name: snapd
    type: snapd
    default-channel: latest/candidate # temporary for latest pc-gadget compatibility; see https://github.com/canonical/edgex-ubuntu-core-testing/issues/1
    id: PMrrV4ml8uWuEUDBT8dSGnKUYbevVhc4

  # Snap base for EdgeX snaps
  - name: core22
    type: base
    default-channel: latest/stable
    id: amcUKQILKXHHTlmSa7NMdnXSx02dNeeT

  - name: edgexfoundry
    type: app
    default-channel: latest/edge # replace with latest/stable after EdgeX v3 release
    id: AZGf0KNnh8aqdkbGATNuRuxnt1GNRKkV

  - name: edgex-device-virtual
    type: app
    default-channel: latest/edge # replace with latest/stable after EdgeX v3 release
    id: AmKuVTOfsN0uEKsyJG34M8CaMfnIqxc0
```

!!! note
    We use the gadget and kernel snaps for 64bit personal computers using Intel or AMD processors. For a Raspberry Pi, you need to change the model, architecture, as well as the gadget and kernel snaps.

!!! tip "Snap ID"
    Query the unique store ID of a snap, for example the `edgexfoundry` snap:
    ```
    $ snap info edgexfoundry | grep snap-id
    snap-id: AZGf0KNnh8aqdkbGATNuRuxnt1GNRKkV
    ```

4) Sign the model assertion

We sign the model using the `edgex-demo` key created and registered earlier. 

The `snap sign` command takes JSON as input and produces YAML as output! We use the YQ app to convert our model assertion to JSON before passing it in for signing.

```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
# sign
yq eval model.yaml -o=json | snap sign -k edgex-demo > model.signed.yaml

# check the signed model
cat model.signed.yaml
```

!!! note
    You need to repeat the signing every time you change the input model, because the signature is calculated based on the model.

### Build the Ubuntu Core image
We use ubuntu-image and set the path to signed model assertion YAML file.

This will download all the snaps specified in the model assertion and build an image file called `pc.img`.

> **Note**  
> If you plan to use an emulator to install and run Ubuntu Core from the resulting image, it is a good idea to allocate additional writable storage. This necessary if you want to install additional snaps interactively or upgrade existing ones on the emulator.
>
> The default size of the `ubuntu-data` partition is `1G` as defined in the gadget snap. When installing on actual hardware, this partition extends automatically to take the whole remaining space on the disk volume. However, when using QEMU, the partition will have the exact same size because the image size is calculated based on the defined partition structure. The 1GB `ubuntu-data` partition will be 90% full after first boot. You can configure the image to be larger so that the installer expands the partition automatically as with a large disk volume. 
>
> To extend the image size, use the `--image-size` flag in the following command. For example, to add 500MB extra (the original image is around 3.5GB), set `--image-size=4G`.

```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ ubuntu-image snap model.signed.yaml --validation=enforce
Fetching snapd
Fetching pc-kernel
Fetching core22
Fetching pc
Fetching edgexfoundry
Fetching edgex-device-virtual

# check the created image file
$ file pc.img
pc.img: DOS/MBR boot sector, extended partition table (last)
```

!!! done
    The image file is now ready to be flashed on a medium to create a bootable drive with the needed applications!

### Boot into the OS
You can now flash the image on your disk and boot to start the installation.
However, during development it is best to boot in an emulator to quickly detect and diagnose possible issues.

Instead of flashing and installing the OS on actual hardware, we will continue this guide using an emulator. Every other step will be similar to when image is flashed and installed on actual hardware.

Refer to the following to:

- [Run in an emulator](#run-in-an-emulator) - used in this guide
- [Flash the image on disk](#flash-the-image-on-disk)

### TRY IT OUT
In this step, we connect to the machine that has the image installed over SSH, validate the installation, and do some manual configurations.

We SSH to the emulator from the previous step:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
ssh <user>@localhost -p 8022
```
If you used the default approach (using `console-conf`) and entered your Ubuntu account email address at the end of the installation, then `<user>` is your Ubuntu account ID. If you don't know your ID, look it up using a browser from [here](https://login.ubuntu.com/) or programmatically from `https://login.ubuntu.com/api/v2/keys/<email>`.

List the installed snaps and their services:
``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
$ snap list

```

Everything is inactive by default. Let start the platform:
``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
$ snap start --enable edgexfoundry
Started.
```

We need to also start Device Virtual, but before doing so, increase the logging verbosity using snap options to add logging for the produced data:
``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
$ snap set edgex-device-virtual config.writable-loglevel=DEBUG
$ snap start --enable edgex-device-virtual
Started.
```

Inspect the logs:
``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
$ snap logs edgexfoundry
...

All services appear healthy.
The Device Virtual logs show that the service is producing the expected synthetic data.

Let's exit the SSH session:
``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
$ exit
logout

```

... and query data from outside via the API Gateway:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
curl --insecure https://localhost:8443/core-data/api/v3/reading/all?limit=2
```

Since the security is enabled, the access is not authorized.
You can follow the instructions from the [getting started](../../getting-started/Ch-GettingStartedSnapUsers/#adding-api-gateway-users) to add a user to API Gateway, and generate a JWT token to access the API securely.

In this chapter, we demonstrated how to build an image that is pre-loaded with some EdgeX snaps. We then connected into a (virtual) machine instantiated with the image, verified the setup and performed additional steps to interactively start and configure the services.

In the next chapter, we walk you through creating an image that comes pre-loaded with this configuration, so it boots into a working EdgeX environment.

## B. Override basic configurations
    
In this chapter, we will improve our OS image so that:

- EdgeX services start automatically
- EdgeX security is disabled for demonstration purposes

### Seeding default configurations
Setting up default options for snaps is possible with a gadget snap. 

The [`pc` gadget](https://snapcraft.io/pc) is available as a prebuilt snap in the store, however, in this chapter, we need to build our own to seed default values. 
We will use the source code for Core22 AMD64 gadget from [here](https://github.com/snapcore/pc-amd64-gadget/tree/22) as basis.

!!! tip
    For a Raspberry Pi, you need to use the [pi-gadget](https://github.com/snapcore/pi-gadget) instead.

Clone the branch and enter the directory:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
git clone https://github.com/snapcore/pc-amd64-gadget.git --branch=22
cd pc-amd64-gadget
```

Add the following root level object to `gadget.yml`:
```yml
defaults:
  # edgexfoundry
  AZGf0KNnh8aqdkbGATNuRuxnt1GNRKkV: # snap id
    # automatically start all the services
    autostart: true
    # disable security
    security: false
    # override a single service's startup message
    apps.core-data.config.service-startupmsg: "Core Data Startup message from gadget!"
    # set bind address of services to all interfaces via the common config
    apps.core-common-config-bootstrapper.config.all-services-service-serverbindaddr: 0.0.0.0
    
  # edgex-device-virtual
  AmKuVTOfsN0uEKsyJG34M8CaMfnIqxc0: # snap id
    # automatically start the service
    autostart: true
    config:
      # configure the service so it does not use the secret store
      edgex-security-secret-store: false
      # override the startup message
      service-startupmsg: "Startup message from gadget!"
```

For service startup and other configuration overrides, refer to [Managing services](../../getting-started/Ch-GettingStartedSnapUsers/#managing-services) and [Config Overrides](../../getting-started/Ch-GettingStartedSnapUsers/#config-overrides).


Build:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ snapcraft -v
...
Created snap package pc_22-0.3_amd64.snap
```

!!! note
    You need to rebuild the snap every time you change the gadget.yaml file.

### Build the image
Use ubuntu-image tool again to build a new image. Use the same instructions as [before](#build-the-ubuntu-core-image) but with an additional flag to set the path to gadget snap that we locally built above.

```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ ubuntu-image snap model.signed.yaml --validation=enforce --snap pc-amd64-gadget/pc_22-0.3_amd64.snap
Fetching snapd
Fetching pc-kernel
Fetching core22
Fetching edgexfoundry
Fetching edgex-device-virtual
WARNING: "pc" installed from local snaps disconnected from a store cannot be refreshed subsequently!
Copying "pc-amd64-gadget/pc_22-0.3_amd64.snap" (pc)
```

The warning is because we side-loaded the gadget for demonstration purposes. In production settings, a custom gadget would need to be uploaded to the [IoT App Store](https://ubuntu.com/internet-of-things/appstore) to also receive updates.

!!! note
    You need to repeat the build every time you change and sign the **model** or rebuild the **gadget**.

!!! done
    The image file is now ready to be flashed on a medium to create a bootable drive with the needed applications and basic configurations.

### TRY IT OUT
Refer to the following to:

- [Run in an emulator](#run-in-an-emulator) - used in this guide
- [Flash the image on disk](#flash-the-image-on-disk)

This time, as set in the gadget defaults, services are started by default and security is disabled.

!!! info
    SSH to the machine and verify some of the seeded configurations:
    ``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
    $ snap services
    Service                                       Startup   Current   Notes

    edgexfoundry.vault                            disabled  inactive  -
    
    $ snap get edgex-device-virtual -d
    {
      "autostart": true,
      "config": {
        "edgex-security-secret-store": false,
        "service-startupmsg": "Startup message from gadget!"
      }
    }
    ```

    Verify that Device Virtual has the startup message set from the gadget:
    ``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
    $ snap logs -n=all edgex-device-virtual | grep "Startup message"
    2023-05-24T16:52:05Z edgex-device-virtual.device-virtual[2807]: level=INFO ts=2023-05-24T16:52:05.791386915Z app=device-virtual source=variables.go:457 msg="Variables override of 'Service/StartupMsg' by environment variable: SERVICE_STARTUPMSG=Startup message from gadget!"

    ```

Since security is disabled and Core Data has been configured to listen on all interfaces (instead of just the loopback), we can now query data (insecurely) from outside:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ curl --no-progress-meter http://localhost:59880/api/v3/reading/all?limit=2 | jq
{
  "apiVersion": "v3",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "totalCount": 86,
  "readings": [
    {

    },
    {

      "valueType": "Uint32",
      "value": "2463192424"
    }
  ]
}

```

In this chapter, we created an OS image which comes with EdgeX components that have overridden server configurations.
We can extend the server configurations by setting other defaults in the gadget.
This mechanism is made possible via a combination of snap options and environment variable overrides implemented for EdgeX services.

Overriding configuration fields is sufficient in most scenarios.
However, there are situations in which we need to override entire configuration files instead of just some fields:

1. When we want to override entire server configuration files, rather than a few fields.
2. When we need to add or change device, profile, and provision watcher configurations.

For the above cases, we need to supply whole configuration files to applications.
In the next chapter, we walk through creating a Snap package with custom configuration files.
The package will become part of the OS image and supply necessary configurations to all other EdgeX applications.

## C. Override configuration files

This chapter builds on top of what we did previously and shows how to override entire configuration files with a packaged copy, prepared for an specific use case.

### Create a config provider for Device Virtual
The EdgeX Device Virtual service cannot be fully configured using environment variables / snap options. Because of that, we need to package the modified config files and replace the defaults.
Moreover, it is tedious to override many configurations one by one, compared to having a file which contains all the needed modifications.

Since we want to create an OS image pre-loaded with the configured system, we need to make sure the configurations are there without any manual user interaction. We do that by creating a snap which provides the configuration files/directories to the Device Virtual snap:

- configuration.toml
- devices/
- profiles/

For this exercise, we will modify the default configurations and remove most default devices and resources. We will also replace the startup message set in the `configuration.toml` file.

This snap should be build and uploaded to the store. We use `edgex-config-provider-example` as the snap name. Refer to [docs](../../getting-started/Ch-GettingStartedSnapUsers/#config-provider-snap) for more details and example source code.

Build:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ snapcraft
...
Snapped edgex-config-provider-example_2.3_amd64.snap
```

This will build for your host architecture, so if your machine is `amd64`, it will result in a snap that has the same architecture. You can perform [remote builds](https://snapcraft.io/docs/remote-build) to build for other architectures.

Let's upload the `amd64` snap and release it to the `latest/edge` channel:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
snapcraft upload --release=latest/edge ./edgex-config-provider-example_2.3_amd64.snap
```

Now, we can query the snap ID from the store:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ snap info edgex-config-provider-example | grep snap-id
snap-id: WWPGZGi1bImphPwrRfw46aP7YMyZYl6w
```
We need it in the next step.


### Add the config provider to the image

We have to make three adaptations:

1) Remove the Device Virtual config overrides from the gadget and re-build it

Commented out (or remove):
```yaml title="gadget.yaml"
    # # Enable app options
    # app-options: true # not necessary because this service has it by default
    # # Override the startup message (because we can)
    # # The same syntax can be used to override most of the server configurations
    # apps.device-virtual.config.service-startupmsg: "Startup message from gadget!"
```

!!! warning
    It is important to do this because overrides are ineffective when configurations are replaced from a config provider.
    This is because the config provider in our example is providing a read-only file system that doesn't allow the write access necessary to inject an environment file when setting the `app` options.

2) Connect the config provider 

```yaml title="gadget.yaml"
connections:
   -  # Connect edgex-device-virtual's plug (consumer)
      plug: AmKuVTOfsN0uEKsyJG34M8CaMfnIqxc0:device-virtual-config
      # to edgex-config-provider-example's slot (provider) to override the default configuration files.
      slot: WWPGZGi1bImphPwrRfw46aP7YMyZYl6w:device-virtual-config
```
This internally bind-mounts provider's "res" directory on top of the consumer's "res" directory.


3) Rebuild the gadget
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ snapcraft
...
Snapped pc_20-0.4_amd64.snap
```

4) Add the config provider snap to the model assertion, **after** all other edgex snaps:

```yaml title="model.yaml"
# This snap contains our configuration files
- name: edgex-config-provider-example
  type: app
  default-channel: latest/edge
  id: WWPGZGi1bImphPwrRfw46aP7YMyZYl6w
```

5) Sign the model as before
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
yq eval model.yaml -o=json | snap sign -k edgex-demo > model.signed.yaml
```
### Build the image
Use ubuntu-image tool again to build a new image. Use the same instructions as [before](#build-the-ubuntu-core-image) to build:

```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
ubuntu-image snap model.signed.yaml --validation=enforce --snap pc-amd64-gadget/pc_20-0.4_amd64.snap
```

Note the addition of our config provider in output:
```
...
Fetching edgex-config-provider-example
...
```

!!! done
    The image file is now ready to be flashed on a medium to create a bootable drive with the needed applications and custom configuration files.

### TRY IT OUT
Refer to the following to:

- [Run in an emulator](#run-in-an-emulator) - used in this guide
- [Flash the image on disk](#flash-the-image-on-disk)

!!! info
    SSH to the machine and verify the installations:
    
    List of snaps:
    ``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
    $ snap list
    Name                           Version          Rev    Tracking       Publisher   Notes

    ```
    Note that we now also have `edgex-config-provider-example` in the list.

    Verify that Device Virtual only has one profile, as configured in the config provider:
    ``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
    $ snap install edgex-cli
    edgex-cli 2.2.0 from Canonicalâœ“ installed
    $ edgex-cli device list
    Name                 Description                ServiceName     ProfileName          Labels                    AutoEvents
    Random-Float-Device  Example of Device Virtual  device-virtual  Random-Float-Device  [device-virtual-example]  [{30s false Float64}]
    ```

    Verify that Device Virtual has the startup message set from the provider:
    ``` title="ðŸš€ Ubuntu Core"
    $ snap logs -n=all edgex-device-virtual | grep "Startup message"
    2022-08-19T14:42:24Z edgex-device-virtual.device-virtual[5402]: level=INFO ts=2022-08-19T14:42:24.438798115Z app=device-virtual source=message.go:55 msg="Startup message from config provider"
    ```

Query the metadata of Device Virtual from your host machine. 
We have to use the same JWT created in chapter B.
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
curl --insecure --silent --show-err https://localhost:8443/core-data/api/v2/reading/all?limit=2 -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat admin-jwt.txt)" | jq

## Run in an emulator
Running the image in an emulator makes it easier to quickly try the image and find out possible issues.

We use a `amd64` QEMU emulator. Refer to [Testing Ubuntu Core with QEMU](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/testing-with-qemu) to setup the dependencies and learn about the various emulation options. Here, we provide the command to run without TPM emulation.

!!! warning
    The `pc.img` file passed to the emulator is used as the secondary storage. It persists any changes made to the partitions during the installation and any user modifications after the boot.
    You can stop and re-start the emulator at a later time without losing your changes.

    To do a fresh start or to flash this image on disk, your need to rebuild the image.
    Alternatively, you can make a copy before using it in QEMU.

Run the following command and wait for the boot to complete:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
sudo qemu-system-x86_64 \
 -smp 4 \
 -m 4096 \
 -drive file=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd,if=pflash,format=raw,unit=0,readonly=on \
 -drive file=pc.img,cache=none,format=raw,id=disk1,if=none \
 -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=disk1,bootindex=1 \
 -machine accel=kvm \
 -serial mon:stdio \
 -net nic,model=virtio \
 -net user,hostfwd=tcp::8022-:22,hostfwd=tcp::8443-:8443,hostfwd=tcp::59880-:59880
```

The above command forwards:

- SSH port `22` of the emulator to `8022` on the host
- API Gateway's port `8433` for external and secure access to EdgeX endpoints
- Core Data's port `59880` for demonstration purposes in chapter A.

!!! failure "Could not set up host forwarding rule 'tcp::8443-:8443'"
    This means that the port 8443 is not available on the host. Try stopping the service that uses this port or change the host port (left hand side) to another port number, e.g. `tcp::18443-:8443`.
    
!!! success
    Once the installation is complete, you'll see the initialization interface; Refer [here](#initialization) for details.

## Flash the image on disk
!!! warning
    If you have used `pc.img` to install in QEMU, the image has changed. You need to rebuild a new copy before continuing.

The installation instructions are device specific. You may refer to Ubuntu Core section in [this page](https://ubuntu.com/download/iot). For example:

- [Intel NUC](https://ubuntu.com/download/intel-nuc) - applicable to most computers with an attached secondary storage
- [Raspberry Pi](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi)

A precondition to continue with some of the instructions is to compress `pc.img`. This speeds up the transfer and makes the input file similar to official images, improving compatibility with the available instructions.

To compress with the lowest compression rate of zero:
```bash title="ðŸ–¥ Desktop"
$ xz -vk -0 pc.img
pc.img (1/1)
  100 %     817.2 MiB / 3,309.0 MiB = 0.247    10 MiB/s       5:30             

$ ls -lh pc.*
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 3.3G Sep 16 17:03 pc.img
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 818M Sep 16 17:03 pc.img.xz
```
A higher compression rate significantly increases the processing time and needed resources, with very little gain.

Follow the device specific instructions.

!!! success
    You may refer [here](#initialization) for the initialization steps appearing by default.

## Initialization
Once the installation is complete, you will see the interface of the `console-conf` program. It will walk you through the networking and user account setup. You'll need to enter the email address of your Ubuntu account to create a OS user account with your registered username and have your SSH public keys deployed as authorized SSH keys for that user.
If you haven't done so, follow the instructions [here](https://snapcraft.io/docs/creating-your-developer-account) to add your SSH keys before doing this setup.

Read [here](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/system-user) to know how the manual account setup looks like and how it can be automated.
