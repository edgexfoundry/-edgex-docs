**Threat Model Name:** EdgeX Foundry Threat Model

**Owner:** Jim White (IOTech Systems)

**Reviewer:** Bryon Nevis, Lenny Goodell, Jim Wang (all from Intel),
Farshid Tavakolizadeh (Canonical), Rodney Hess (Beechwoods)

**Contributors:**

**Description:** General Threat Model for EdgeX Foundry - inclusive of
security elements (Kong, Vault, etc).

**Assumptions:** EdgeX is platform agnostic, but this Threat model
assumes the underlying OS is a Linux distribution. EdgeX can run
containerized or non-containerized (natively). This Threat Model assumes
EdgeX is running in a containerized environment (Docker). EdgeX micro
services can run distributed, but this Threat Model assumes EdgeX is
running on a single host (single Docker deamon with a single Docker
network unless otherwise specified). Many different devices/sensors can
be connected to EdgeX via its device services. This Threat model treats
all sensors/devices the same (which is not always the case given the
varoius protocols of support). Per
https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.0/threat-models/secret-store/threat_model/,
additional hardening such as secure boot with hardware root of trust,
and secure disk encryption are outside of EdgeX control but would
greatly improve the threat mitigation.

**External Dependencies:** Operating system and hardware (including
devices/sensors) Device/sensor drivers Possibly a cloud system or
external enterprise system that EdgeX gets data to A message bus broker
(such as an MQTT broker)

#### 1. Weak Access Control for a Resource  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Low\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Information Disclosure |
| **Description:** | Improper data protection of Consul (configuration) can allow an attacker to read information not intended for disclosure. Review authorization settings. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | EdgeX services that use Consul must use a Vault access token provided in bootstrapping of the service. See https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.3/security/Ch-Secure-Consul/. There is also per service ACL rules in place to limit Consul access. As of the Ireland release, access of Consul requires ACL token header X-Consul-Token in any HTTP calls. Moreover, Consul itself is now bootstrapped and started with its ACL system enabled and thus provides better authentication and authorization security features for services. In other words, with the required Consul's ACL token for accessing Consul, assets inside Consul like EdgeX's configuration items in Key-Value (KV) store are now better protected. |

#### 2. Spoofing of Source Data Store Consul (configuration)  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Low\] 

 |     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Spoofing |
| **Description:** | Consul (configuration) may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to incorrect data delivered to EdgeX Foundry. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the source data store. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | If someone was able to provide a container that was spoofing as Consul, the service would not know that the response came from something other than Consul. However, Consul is run as a container on the EdgeX Docker network. Replacing/spoofing the Consul container would require privileaged (root) access to the host. Additional adopter mitigation would include putting TLS in place between EdgeX and Consul (with TLS cert in place). A spoofing service (in this case Consul), would not have the appropriate cert in place to participate in the communications. |

#### 3. Spoofing of Source Data Store Configuration Files  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Low\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Spoofing |
| **Description:** | Configuration Files may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to incorrect data delivered to EdgeX Foundry. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the source data store. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Configuration files are used to seed EdgeX configuration service (Consul) before the services are started. Configuration files are made part of the service container (deployed with the container image). The only way to spoof the file is to replace the entire service container with new configuration or to transplant new configuration in the container - both require privileaged access to the host. |
| **Mitigator:** | EdgeX Foundry |
| **Mitigation Status:** | Mitigation reviewed |


#### 4. Weak Access Control for a Resource  \[State: Not Applicable\]  \[Priority: Low\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Information Disclosure |
| **Description:** | Improper data protection of Configuration Files can allow an attacker to read information not intended for disclosure. Review authorization settings. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Disclosure of configuration files is not important. Configuration data is not considered sensitive. As long as the configuration files are not manipulated, then access to configuration files is not deemed a threat. All secret configuration is made available through Vault. |
| **Mitigator:** | No mitigation or not applicable |
| **Mitigation Status:** | Cannot mitigate or not appilcable |

### Interaction: data

#### 5. Spoofing of Source Data Store Redis  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Low\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Spoofing |
| **Description:** | Redis may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to incorrect data delivered to EdgeX Foundry. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the source data store. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | If someone was able to provide a container that was spoofing as Redis, the service would not know that the response came from something other than Redis. However, Redis is run as a container on the EdgeX Docker network. Replacing/spoofing the Redis container would require privileaged (root) access to the host. Additional adopter mitigation would include putting TLS in place between EdgeX and Redis (with TLS cert in place). A spoofing service (in this case Redis), would not have the appropriate cert in place to participate in the communications. |

#### 6. Weak Access Control for a Resource  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Low\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Information Disclosure |
| **Description:** | Improper data protection of Redis can allow an attacker to read information not intended for disclosure. Review authorization settings. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Access control credentials for Redis are secured in Vault (provided to EdgeX services at bootstrapping but otherwise unknown). Access without credentials is denied. |
| **Mitigator:** | EdgeX Foundry |
| **Mitigation Status:** | Mitigation reviewed |

#### 7. Authenticated Data Flow Compromised  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Low\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Tampering |
| **Description:** | An attacker can read or modify data transmitted over an authenticated dataflow. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | EdgeX containers communicate via a Docker network. A hacker would need to gain access to the host and have elevated privileages on the host to access the network traffic. If extra security is needed or if an adopter is running EdgeX services in a distributed environment (multiple hosts), then overlay network encryption can be used (see example: https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-examples/tree/update-custom-trigger-multiple-pipelines/security/remote_devices/docker-swarm) |

| **Mitigation Status:** | Mitigation reviewed |

### Interaction: published message

![published message interaction

#### 8. Potential Excessive Resource Consumption for EdgeX Foundry or Message Bus Broker  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Medium\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Denial Of Service |
| **Description:** | Does EdgeX Foundry or Message Bus Broker take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | The EdgeX message broker is either Redis Pub/Sub or an MQTT broker like Mosquitto and runs as a container in a Docker network that, by default with security on, does not allow direct access to the broker. Access to publish or subscribe to cause it to use excessive resources would require authorized access to the host as the port to the internal message broker is protected. In other words, EdgeX mitigates unauthorized attacks resulting in DoS event, but would not mitigate authorized attacks (such as a service producing too many message than the broker can handle) that result in a DoS event. |

| **Mitigation Status:** | Mitigation reviewed |

#### 9\. Spoofing of Destination Data Store Message Bus  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Low\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Spoofing |
| **Description:** | Message Bus may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of Message Bus. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | The message bus when requiring a broker (MQTT broker for example) is run as a container on the EdgeX Docker network. Replacing/spoofing the broker container would require privileaged access to the host. Message broker host and port are part of services' configuration (covered under threats against configuration) |

#### 10. Spoofing of Destination Data Store Redis  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Low\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Spoofing |
| **Description:** | Redis may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of Redis. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store. |

Additional adopter mitigation would include putting TLS in place between EdgeX and Redis (with TLS cert in place). A spoofing service (in this case Redis), would not have the appropriate cert in place to participate in the communications. Database host and port are part of services' configuration (covered under threats against configuration) |

#### 11\. Authenticated Data Flow Compromised  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Low\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Tampering |
| **Description:** | An attacker can read or modify data transmitted over an authenticated dataflow. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | EdgeX containers communicate via a Docker network. Docker containers do not share the host's network interface by default and instead is based on virtual ethernet adapters and bridges. A hacker would need to gain access to the host and have elevated privileages on the host to access the network traffic. If extra security is needed or if an adopter is running EdgeX services in a distributed environment (multiple hosts), then overlay network encryption can be used (see example: https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-examples/tree/update-custom-trigger-multiple-pipelines/security/remote_devices/docker-swarm) |
| **Mitigator:** | EdgeX Foundry |
| **Mitigation Status:** | Mitigation reviewed |

#### 12\. Potential Excessive Resource Consumption for EdgeX Foundry or Redis  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Low\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Denial Of Service |
| **Description:** | Does EdgeX Foundry or Redis take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Redis runs as a container in a Docker network that, by default with security on, does not allow direct access to the database. Access to query or push data into it to cause it to use excessive resources would require authorized access to the host as the port to the database is protected. In other words, EdgeX mitigates unauthorized attacks resulting in DoS event, but would not mitigate authorized attacks (such as a service making too many queries or pushing to much data into it) that result in a DoS event. EdgeX does have a routine with customizable configuration that "cleans up" and removes older data so that "normal" or otherwise expected use of the database for persistenct does not result in DoS. |

#### 13. Spoofing of Destination Data Store Vault  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Low\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Spoofing |
| **Description:** | Vault may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of Vault. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | If someone was able to provide a container that was spoofing as Vault, the service would not know that the response came from something other than Vault. However, Vault is run as a container on the EdgeX Docker network. Replacing/spoofing the Vault container would require privileaged (root) access to the host. Additional adopter mitigation would include putting TLS in place between EdgeX and Vault (with TLS cert in place). A spoofing service (in this case Vault), would not have the appropriate cert in place to participate in the communications. EdgeX services that use Vault must use the go-mod-secrets client or a Vault service token to access its secrets (which is revoked by default). See https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.3/security/Ch-SecretStore/#using-the-secret-store Vault host and port are configured from static configuration or environment overrides (trusted input) and not Consul, making it difficult to misdirect services access to Vault. See EdgeX Threat Model documentation (https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.0/threat-models/secret-store/threat_model/#threat-matrix) for additional considerations and mitigation. |

#### 14\. Potential Excessive Resource Consumption for EdgeX Foundry or Vault  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Low\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Denial Of Service |
| **Description:** | Does EdgeX Foundry or Vault take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Vault runs as a container in a Docker network that, by default with security on, does not allow direct access to the secret store. Access to query or push data into it to cause it to use excessive resources would require authorized access to the host as the port to the database is protected. In other words, EdgeX mitigates unauthorized attacks resulting in DoS event, but would not mitigate authorized attacks (such as a service making too many queries or pushing to many secrets into it) that result in a DoS event. |

#### 15. Spoofing of Destination Data Store Device/Sensor (REST authenticated)  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Low\] 

 |     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Spoofing |
| **Description:** | Device/Sensor (REST authenticated) may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of Device/Sensor (REST authenticated). Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | With authentication in place the REST caller would not get the proper authenticated by a spoofed Kong and thereby deny any query request. |
| **Mitigator:** | EdgeX Foundry |
| **Mitigation Status:** | Mitigation reviewed |

#### 16\. The Device/Sensor (REST authenticated) Data Store Could Be Corrupted  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: High\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Tampering |
| **Description:** | Data flowing across query may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to corruption of Device/Sensor (REST authenticated). Ensure the integrity of the data flow to the data store. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | REST requests and responses to/through Kong are encrypted by default. |
| **Mitigator:** | Third Party |
| **Mitigation Status:** | Mitigation reviewed |

#### 17\. Data Store Denies Device/Sensor (REST authenticated) Potentially Writing Data  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Low\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Repudiation |
| **Description:** | Device/Sensor (REST authenticated) claims that it did not write data received from an entity on the other side of the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Use of elevated log level (set writable configuration log level to DEBUG in the device service) can be used to log all data communications. |
| **Mitigator:** | EdgeX Foundry |
| **Mitigation Status:** | Mitigation reviewed |

#### 18\. Data Flow query Is Potentially Interrupted  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Medium\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Denial Of Service |
| **Description:** | An external agent interrupts data flowing across a trust boundary in either direction. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Outside influence could break the network communication connection causing major disruption of service (ex: removing or cutting off comms to a critical temperature resource of a heating or cooling machine). EdgeX has no means to protect the network connection. Physical security is required to protect the wire and device/sensor and mitigate this threat. The device service does track "last connected" and that timestamp could be monitored for outside of normal reporting ranges. |
| **Mitigator:** | Adopter |
| **Mitigation Status:** | Mitigation written |

#### 19\. Data Store Inaccessible  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: Medium\] 

|     |     |

#### 20\. Data Store Inaccessible  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: High\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Denial Of Service |
| **Description:** | An external agent prevents access to a data store on the other side of the trust boundary. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Outside influence could break the communication connection or MQTT broker causing major disruption of service (ex: removing or cutting off comms to a critical temperature sensor of a heating or cooling machine). EdgeX has no means to protect the connection to the external MQTT broker, the broker itself, or subscriber to the broker. Physical and sytem security is required to protect these and mitigate this threat. Query requests that do not receive a response would result in an error that could be responded to. |

| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Outside influence could break the communication connection or MQTT broker causing major disruption of service (ex: removing or cutting off comms to a critical temperature sensor of a heating or cooling machine). EdgeX has no means to protect the connection to the external MQTT broker, the broker itself, or publisher to the broker. Physical and sytem security is required to protect these and mitigate this threat. |

#### 22\. Potential Excessive Resource Consumption for EdgeX Foundry or Device/Sensor (via external MQTT broker - authenticated)  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: High\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Denial Of Service |
| **Description:** | Does EdgeX Foundry or Device/Sensor (via external MQTT broker - authenticated) take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | EdgeX could send too many requests for data that cause the broker or subscriber to go offline or appear unresponsive - depending on the capabilities of the broker or subscribing application. In the opposite direction, an MQTT publisher could be tampered with or improperly configured to send too much data (overwhelming the EdgeX system or MQTT broker) causing a DoS. Other than writing the device service to filter data to avoid the “too much” data DoS, this threat is not mitigated. |
| **Mitigator:** | Adopter |
| **Mitigation Status:** | Mitigation reviewed |

#### 23\. Data Flow Sniffing  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: High\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Information Disclosure |
| **Description:** | Data flowing across query may be sniffed by an attacker. Depending on what type of data an attacker can read, it may be used to attack other parts of the system or simply be a disclosure of information leading to compliance violations. Consider encrypting the data flow. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Requires encryption of the communications (on both the EdgeX and device/sensor ends) which is not in place by default. MQTTS could be implemented by the adopter with the appropriate MQTT broker. |
| **Mitigator:** | Adopter |
| **Mitigation Status:** | Mitigation reviewed |

#### 24\. Data Store Denies Device/Sensor (via external MQTT broker - authenticated) Potentially Writing Data  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: High\]

| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Repudiation |
| **Description:** | Device/Sensor (via external MQTT broker - authenticated) claims that it did not write data received from an entity on the other side of the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Use of elevated log level (set writable configuration log level to DEBUG in the device service) can be used to log all data communications. Log level on the message bus may also be elevated. |

#### 26\. Spoofing of Destination Data Store Device/Sensor (via external MQTT broker - authenticated)  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: High\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Spoofing |
| **Description:** | Device/Sensor (via external MQTT broker - authenticated) may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of Device/Sensor (via external MQTT broker - authenticated). Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | With authentication in place the spoofing MQTT query sendor (or the spoofed external message broker) would not be properly authenticated and thereby be unable to publish. The EdgeX framework has the support to store secrets to authenticate devices. Broker host and port are part of services' configuration (covered under threats against configuration) |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Spoofing |
| **Description:** | EdgeX Foundry may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to unauthorized access to Device/Sensor (via external MQTT broker - authenticated). Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the source process. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | With authentication in place the spoofing MQTT publisher of a query (or the spoofed external message broker) would not be properly authenticated and thereby be unable to make its request. The EdgeX framework has the support to store secrets to authenticate devices. Broker host and port are part of services' configuration (covered under threats against configuration) |

#### 29\. Spoofing of Destination Data Store Device/Sensor  \[State: Needs Investigation\]  \[Priority: High\]

| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Spoofing |
| **Description:** | Device/Sensor may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of Device/Sensor. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Due to the nature of many protocols, an outside agent could spoof a legitimate device/sensor. This is of particular concern if the device service auto provisions the devices/sensors without any authentication. Auto provisioning shold be limited to pick up trusted devices. Protocols such as BACnet do allow for authentication with the device/sensor. Commercial 3rd party software or extensions to EdgeX (see, for example, RSA’s Netwitness IoT: https://www.netwitness.com/en-us/products/iot/) could be used to detect anomalous sensor/device communications and isolate the sensor from the system, but there is no ability in EdgeX directly to protect against a spoofed device/sensor that does not authenticate (which is the norm in some older OT protocols). |

#### 30\. The Device/Sensor Data Store Could Be Corrupted  \[State: Not Applicable\]  \[Priority: High\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Tampering |
| **Description:** | Data flowing across query or actuation may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to corruption of Device/Sensor. Ensure the integrity of the data flow to the data store. I.e. - example: a man in the middle attack on the wire between EdgeX and the wired device/sensor or an attack on the sensor (giggling a vibration sensor) |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Outside influence on a sensor or device or intercept/use of the data to the device/sensor is one of the biggest threats to an edge system and one of the hardest to mitigate. If tampered with, a sensor or device could be used to send the wrong data (e.g., force a temp sensor to send a signal that it is too hot when it is really too cold), too much data (overwhelming the edge system by causing the sensor to send data too often), or not enough data (e.g., disconnecting a critical monitor sensor that would cause a system to stop). EdgeX has no means to protect the "wire" to a physically connected device/sensor. Physical security is required to protect the wire and mitigate this threat. Additional optional mitigation ideas require modifications to the EdgeX device service. The device service could be constructed to filter data to avoid the “too much” data DoS. The device service can be constructed to report and alert when there is not enough data coming from the device or sensor or the sensor/device appears to be offline (provided by the last connected tracking in EdgeX). Wrong data can be mitigated by having the device service look for expected ranges of values (as supported by min/max attributes on device profiles). All of these have limits and only mitigate the data from being used in the rest of EdgeX once received by the device service. Commercial 3rd party software or extensions to EdgeX (see, for example, RSA’s Netwitness IoT: https://www.netwitness.com/en-us/products/iot/) could also be used to detect anomalous sensor/device communications and isolate the sensor from the system. |

#### 32\. Data Flow Sniffing  \[State: Not Applicable\]  \[Priority: High\]

Depending on what type of data an attacker can read, it may be used to attack other parts of the system or simply be a disclosure of information leading to compliance violations. Consider encrypting the data flow. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Securing the data flow to/from a device or sensor is dependent on the OT protocol. In the case of most simple and typically older OT protocols (Modbus or GPIO as examples), there is no way to secure the communications with the device/sensor under that protocol. Critical sensors/devices of this nature should be physically secured (along with their physical connection to the EdgeX host). |

Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | EdgeX could send too many requests for data or actuation requests that cause the sensor / device to go offline or appear unresponsive - depending on the sophistication of the device/sensor. In the opposite direction, a device/sensor could be tampered with or improperly configured to send too much data (overwhelming the EdgeX system) causing a DoS. Other than writing the device service to filter data to avoid the “too much” data DoS, this threat is not mitigated. |

Replacing/spoofing the Kong container would require privileaged (root) access to the host.

#### 59\. Potential Lack of Input Validation for EdgeX UI - Web Application  \[State: Needs Investigation\]  \[Priority: Medium\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Tampering |
| **Description:** | Data flowing across request may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to a denial of service attack against EdgeX UI - Web Application or an elevation of privilege attack against EdgeX UI - Web Application or an information disclosure by EdgeX UI - Web Application. Failure to verify that input is as expected is a root cause of a very large number of exploitable issues. Consider all paths and the way they handle data. Verify that all input is verified for correctness using an approved list input validation approach. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Input validation should be added to the GUI. However, access to the Web GUI (and then EdgeX) requires the API gateway token (see https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.2/getting-started/tools/Ch-GUI/#secure-mode-with-api-gateway-token). If this threat is likely, the Web GUI can be removed as this does not impact the remainder of EdgeX operations. |

| **Description:** | EdgeX UI - Web Application may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to information disclosure by Browser/API Caller. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination process. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | As one of the services deployed as a container of EdgeX, spoofing of EdgeX GUI would require either replacing the container (requiring host access and elevated privileges) and/or intercepting and rerouting traffic. Further, the GUI must obtain and use a Kong JWT token to access the EdgeX APIs which a spoofer would not have. |

| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Because the Web application is running as a container on the Docker network with Kong, access to the response traffic via Kong would require access to the Docker network (requiring access to the host with elevated privilege).

| **Category:** | Elevation Of Privilege |
| **Description:** | EdgeX UI - Web Application may be able to impersonate the context of Kong in order to gain additional privilege. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | The Web GUI must authenticate with Kong using a JWT token (see https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.2/getting-started/tools/Ch-GUI/#secure-mode-with-api-gateway-token). Without the proper JWT token access, the Web GUI cannot get eleveated privilege to EdgeX as a whole. An impersonating Web GUI might be used to have a user provide their JWT token which could be used to then perform other operations in EdgeX. If this is a real threat, the GUI can be removed and not used without other impacts to EdgeX. The GUI is a convenience tool. |

| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Denial Of Service |
| **Description:** | An external agent interrupts data flowing across a trust boundary in either direction. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | While a DoS on the GUI is possible (its endpoint is accessible on the Docker network), the GUI would not prevent the critical work of EdgeX from continuing. Kong prevents unauthorized access beyond the GUI. Kong can also be used to throttle requests coming from the GUI or other caller (see https://keyvatech.com/2019/12/03/secure-your-business-critical-apps-with-kong/). Other mechisms exist to work with EdgeX (such as the service APIs). The GUI is a convenience. It can be removed if a high risk target without affect to the rest of EdgeX. |

| **Category:** | Spoofing |
| **Description:** | EdgeX Foundry may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to information disclosure by Device/Sensor. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination process. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Without an authentication protocol, there is no mitigation for this threat. The device would not be able to determine that the Spoofing EdgeX caller is not EdgeX. |

#### 75\. Spoofing of Source Data Store Device/Sensor  \[State: Not Applicable\]  \[Priority: High\]

| **Category:** | Spoofing |
| **Description:** | Device/Sensor may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to incorrect data delivered to EdgeX Foundry. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the source data store. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Due to the nature of many protocols, an outside agent could spoof as a ligitimage device/sensor. This is of particular concern if the device service auto provisions the devices/sensors without any authentication. Auto provisioning shold be limited to pick up trusted devices. Protocols such as BACnet do allow for authentication with the device/sensor. Commercial 3rd party software or extensions to EdgeX (see, for example, RSA’s Netwitness IoT: https://www.netwitness.com/en-us/products/iot/) could be used to detect anomalous sensor/device communications and isolate the sensor from the system, but there is no ability in EdgeX directly to protect against a spoofed device/sensor that does not authenticate (which is the norm in some older OT protocols). |

| **Category:** | Information Disclosure |
| **Description:** | Improper data protection of Device/Sensor can allow an attacker to read information not intended for disclosure. Review authorization settings. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Securing the data flow to/from a device or sensor is dependent on the OT protocol. In the case of most simple and typically older OT protocols (Modbus or GPIO as examples), there is no way to secure the communications with the device/sensor under that protocol. Critical sensors/devices of this nature should be physically secured (along with their physical connection to the EdgeX host). |

| **Description:** | EdgeX Foundry crashes, halts, stops or runs slowly; in all cases violating an availability metric. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Stopping EdgeX services requires host access (and access to the Docker engine, Docker containers and Docker network) with eleveated privileges or access to the EdgeX system management APIs (requiring the Kong JWT token). The system management service can be removed for extra security. |

| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Outside influence could break the communication connection or remove a device/senosr causing major disruption of service (ex: removing or cutting off comms to a critical temperature sensor of a heating or cooling machine). EdgeX has no means to protect the "wire" to a physically connected device/sensor. Physical security is required to protect the wire and device/sensor and mitigate this threat.

| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Elevation Of Privilege |
| **Description:** | Device/Sensor may be able to remotely execute code for EdgeX Foundry. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | EdgeX does not execute random code based on input from a device or sensor (as if it was from a web application with something like unsanitized inputs). All data is santized by extracting expected data values from the sensor input data, creating an EdgeX event/reading message and sending that into the rest of EdgeX. The data coming from a sensor could be used to kill the service (ex: buffer overflow attack and sending too much data for the service to consume for example - see DoS threats). The device service in EdgeX can be written to reject to large of a request (for example). In some cases, a protocol may offer dual authentication, and if used, help to mitigate RCE |

| **Category:** | Elevation Of Privilege |
| **Description:** | An attacker may pass data into EdgeX Foundry in order to change the flow of program execution within EdgeX Foundry to the attacker's choosing. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Outside influence on a sensor or device is one of the biggest threats to an edge system and one of the hardest to mitigate. If tampered with, a sensor or device could be used to send the wrong data (e.g., force a temp sensor to send a signal that it is too hot when it is really too cold). EdgeX has no means to protect the "wire" to a physically connected device/sensor. Physical security is required to protect the wire and device/sensor and mitigate this threat. Wrong data can be mitigated by having the device service look for expected ranges of values (as supported by min/max attributes on device profiles). Commercial 3rd party software or extensions to EdgeX (see, for example, RSA’s Netwitness IoT: https://www.netwitness.com/en-us/products/iot/) could be used to detect anomalous sensor/device communications and isolate the sensor from the system. |

| **Possible Mitigation:** | With authentication protocol in place (as examplified by BACnet secured or ONVIF cameras with security on), the spoofing device or sensor would not be able to properly authenticated and thereby be denied the ability to send data, be queried. The EdgeX framework has the support to store secrets to authenticate devices. |

| **Description:** | Improper data protection of Device/Sensor (physically connected authenticated) can allow an attacker to read information not intended for disclosure. Review authorization settings. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Securing the data flow to/from a device or sensor is dependent on the OT protocol. In the case of something like BACnet secure (which is based on TLS - see https://www.bacnetinternational.org/page/secureconnect), the flow between EdgeX and the BACnet device can be encryped. The Device Service would need to be written to use that secure communications. In cases where there is no way to secure the communications with the device/sensor under that protocol, then mitigation is via physical security of the device/sensor (along with their connection to the EdgeX host). |

| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Outside influence could break the communication connection or remove a device/senosr causing major disruption of service (ex: removing or cutting off comms to a critical temperature sensor of a heating or cooling machine). EdgeX has no means to protect the "wire" to a physically connected device/sensor. Physical security is required to protect the wire and device/sensor and mitigate this threat.

| **Category:** | Elevation Of Privilege |
| **Description:** | Device/Sensor (physically connected authenticated) may be able to remotely execute code for EdgeX Foundry. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | EdgeX does not execute random code based on input from a device or sensor (as if it was from a web application with something like unsanitized inputs). All data is santized by extracting expected data values from the sensor input data, creating an EdgeX event/reading message and sending that into the rest of EdgeX. The data coming from a sensor could be used to kill the service (ex: buffer overflow attack and sending too much data for the service to consume for example - see DoS threats). The device service in EdgeX can be written to reject to large of a request (for example). In some cases, a protocol may offer dual authentication, and if used, help to mitigate RCE |

| **Category:** | Elevation Of Privilege |
| **Description:** | An attacker may pass data into EdgeX Foundry in order to change the flow of program execution within EdgeX Foundry to the attacker's choosing. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Outside influence on a sensor or device is one of the biggest threats to an edge system and one of the hardest to mitigate. If tampered with, a sensor or device could be used to send the wrong data (e.g., force a temp sensor to send a signal that it is too hot when it is really too cold). EdgeX has no means to protect the "wire" to a physically connected device/sensor. Physical security is required to protect the wire and device/sensor and mitigate this threat. Wrong data can be mitigated by having the device service look for expected ranges of values (as supported by min/max attributes on device profiles). Commercial 3rd party software or extensions to EdgeX (see, for example, RSA’s Netwitness IoT: https://www.netwitness.com/en-us/products/iot/) could be used to detect anomalous sensor/device communications and isolate the sensor from the system. |

| **Category:** | Denial Of Service |
| **Description:** | Does EdgeX Foundry or Consul (registry) take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | EdgeX services and Consul run as containers in a Docker network that, by default with security on, does not allow direct access to the service APIs. During the process of Consul bootstrapping, the EdgeX security bootstrapper ensures that the Consul APIs and GUI cannot be accessed without an ACL token (see https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.2/security/Ch-Secure-Consul/). Therefore, using the Consul APIs to cause a DoS attack would require access tokens. A rogue authorized user or someone able to illegally get the Consul token could cause excess use of resources that cause the services or Consul down. |

If extra security is needed or if an adopter is running EdgeX services in a distributed environment (multiple hosts), then overlay network encryption can be used (see example: https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-examples/tree/update-custom-trigger-multiple-pipelines/security/remote_devices/docker-swarm). Alternately, TLS can be used to encrypt all traffic. Service-to-service calls behind Kong are unauthenticated in the current implementation. |

| **Description:** | EdgeX Service B may be able to impersonate the context of EdgeX Service A in order to gain additional privilege. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | All services are required to authroize to the message bus, but all services authorized on the message bus have equal privilege to send and receive messages. Impersonating another EdgeX service would require access to the host system and the Docker network. Ports to the service message bus is restricted to internal communications only. If extra security is needed or if an adopter is running EdgeX services in a distributed environment (multiple hosts), then overlay network encryption can be used (see example: https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-examples/tree/update-custom-trigger-multiple-pipelines/security/remote_devices/docker-swarm). Alternately, secure MQTT (MQTTS) message bus communications can be used. |

#### 123\. EdgeX Service A Process Memory Tampered  \[State: Mitigation Implemented\]  \[Priority: High\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Tampering |
| **Description:** | If EdgeX Service A is given access to memory, such as shared memory or pointers, or is given the ability to control what EdgeX Service B executes (for example, passing back a function pointer.), then EdgeX Service A can tamper with EdgeX Service B. Consider if the function could work with less access to memory, such as passing data rather than pointers. Copy in data provided, and then validate it. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Not applicable in containerized environments. Separate processes running in separate containers. |
| **Mitigator:** | Adopter |

#### 124\. Spoofing of Destination Data Store Modbus Device/Sensor  \[State: Needs Investigation\]  \[Priority: High\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Spoofing |
| **Description:** | Modbus Device/Sensor may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of Modbus Device/Sensor. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | As there are no means to secure Modbus communications via the protocol exchange, the Modbus device/sensor and its wired connection must be physically secured to insure no spoofing or unauthorized collection of data or actuation with the device. |
| **Mitigator:** | Adopter |
| **Mitigation Status:** | Mitigation written |

#### 125\. Potential Excessive Resource Consumption for Modbus Device Service or Modbus Device/Sensor  \[State: Needs Investigation\]  \[Priority: High\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Denial Of Service |
| **Description:** | Does Modbus Device Service or Modbus Device/Sensor take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | As an unprotected (physically) Modbus device/sensor can be used to create a DOS attack (sending too much data), or send erroneous/faulty data, or disrupted / cut off and thereofore not send any data, the device service must be written to monitor and thwart the flow of too much data, notify when data is outside of expected ranges and notify when it appears the device/sensor is no longer connected and reporting. Provisioning of the device using known or specific ranges of MAC addresses (or IP addresses if using Modbus TCP/IP), etc. can help onboarding with an unauthorized device. |

#### 126\. Spoofing the Modbus Device Service Process  \[State: Needs Investigation\]  \[Priority: High\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Spoofing |
| **Description:** | Modbus Device Service may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to unauthorized access to Modbus Device/Sensor. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the source process. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | As the communication to a Modbus device / sensor is not authenticated/authorized by the Protocol, any service (any spoof) could appear to be the EdgeX device service and either get data from or (worse) actuate the device illegally. Given the nature of Modbus, the only way to protect against this threat is to physically secure the device and connectivity (wire). |
| **Mitigator:** | No mitigation or not applicable |
| **Mitigation Status:** | Cannot mitigate or not appilcable |

#### 127\. The Modbus Device/Sensor Data Store Could Be Corrupted  \[State: Needs Investigation\]  \[Priority: High\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Tampering |
| **Description:** | Data flowing across Binary RTU (GET or SET) may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to corruption of Modbus Device/Sensor. Ensure the integrity of the data flow to the data store. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | As the communication to a Modbus device / sensor is not authenticated/authorized by the protocol, the communication across the wire could be tampered with or shut off to cause DOS attacts or actuate the device illegally. Given the nature of Modbus, the only way to protect against this threat is to physically secure the device and connectivity (wire). |

#### 128\. Data Store Denies Modbus Device/Sensor Potentially Writing Data  \[State: Not Applicable\]  \[Priority: High\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Repudiation |
| **Description:** | Modbus Device/Sensor claims that it did not write data received from an entity on the other side of the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | It is unlikely that a Modbus device/sensor has a log to provide an audit of requests. |
| **Mitigator:** | No mitigation or not applicable |
| **Mitigation Status:** | Cannot mitigate or not appilcable |

#### 129\. Data Flow Sniffing  \[State: Not Applicable\]  \[Priority: High\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Information Disclosure |
| **Description:** | Data flowing across Binary RTU (GET or SET) may be sniffed by an attacker. Depending on what type of data an attacker can read, it may be used to attack other parts of the system or simply be a disclosure of information leading to compliance violations. Consider encrypting the data flow. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | As the communication to a Modbus device / sensor is not authenticated/authorized nor encrypted by the Protocol, any service (any spoof) could appear to be the EdgeX device service and either get data from or (worse) actuate the device illegally. Given the nature of Modbus, the only way to protect against this threat is to physically secure the device and connectivity (wire). |

#### 130\. Weak Credential Transit  \[State: Needs Investigation\]  \[Priority: High\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Information Disclosure |
| **Description:** | Credentials on the wire are often subject to sniffing by an attacker. Are the credentials re-usable/re-playable? Are credentials included in a message? For example, sending a zip file with the password in the email. Use strong cryptography for the transmission of credentials. Use the OS libraries if at all possible, and consider cryptographic algorithm agility, rather than hardcoding a choice. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Modbus does not support any type of authentication/authorization in communications. Physical security of the device and wire are the only ways to thwart information disclosure. |

| **Category:** | Information Disclosure |
| **Description:** | Improper data protection of Modbus Device/Sensor can allow an attacker to read information not intended for disclosure. Review authorization settings. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | As Modbus is a simple protocol (reporting data or reacting to accuation requests), it is not possible for the device or sensor to gain other data from the device service (or EdgeX as a whole). |

| **Description:** | Modbus Device Service crashes, halts, stops or runs slowly; in all cases violating an availability metric. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Stopping EdgeX services requires host access (and access to the Docker engine, Docker containers and Docker network) with eleveated privileges or access to the EdgeX system management APIs (requiring the Kong JWT token). The system management service can be removed for extra security. |

#### 140\. Modbus Device Service May be Subject to Elevation of Privilege Using Remote Code Execution  \[State: Needs Investigation\]  \[Priority: High\] 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category:** | Elevation Of Privilege |
| **Description:** | Modbus Device/Sensor may be able to remotely execute code for Modbus Device Service. |
| **Justification:** | &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; |
| **Possible Mitigation:** | Outside influence on a sensor or device is one of the biggest threats to an edge system and one of the hardest to mitigate. If tampered with, a sensor or device could be used to send the wrong data (e.g., force a temp sensor to send a signal that it is too hot when it is really too cold), too much data (overwhelming the edge system by causing the sensor to send data too often), or not enough data (e.g., disconnecting a critical monitor sensor that would cause a system to stop). The device service can be constructed to filter data to avoid the “too much” data DoS. The device service can be constructed to report and alert when there is not enough data coming from the device or sensor or the sensor/device appears to be offline (provided by the last connected tracking in EdgeX). Wrong data can be mitigated by having the device service look for expected ranges of values (as supported by min/max attributes on device profiles). Commercial 3rd party software or extensions to EdgeX (see, for example, RSA’s Netwitness IoT: https://www.netwitness.com/en-us/products/iot/) could be used to detect anomalous sensor/device communications and isolate the sensor from the system. |
