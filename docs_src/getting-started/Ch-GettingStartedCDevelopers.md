# Getting Started - C Developers

## Introduction ![image](gcc-logo.png)

These instructions are for C Developers and Contributors to get, run and otherwise work with C-based EdgeX Foundry
micro services. Before reading this guide, review the general [developer requirements](./Ch-GettingStartedDevelopers.md#what-you-need).

If you want to get the EdgeX platform and run it (but do not intend to change or add to the existing code base now) then you are considered a "User". Users should read:
[Getting Started Users](./Ch-GettingStartedUsers.md))

## What You Need For C Development
Many of EdgeX device services are built in C.  In the future, other services could be built in C.  In additional to the hardware and software listed in the [Developers
guide](./Ch-GettingStartedDevelopers.md), to build EdgeX C services, you will need the following:

-   libmicrohttpd
-   libcurl
-   libyaml
-   libcbor

You can install these on Ubuntu by running:
``` bash
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libmicrohttpd-dev libyaml-dev libcbor-dev
```

CMake is required to build the SDKs.  Version 3 or better is required.  You can install CMAKE on Ubuntu by running:
``` bash
sudo apt install cmake
```

Check that your C development environment includes the following:

- a version of GCC supporting C11
- CMake version 3 or greater
- Development libraries and headers for:
    - curl (version 7.32 or later)
    - microhttpd (version 0.9)
    - libyaml (version 0.1.6 or later)
    - libcbor (version 0.5)
    - libuuid (from util-linux v2.x)
