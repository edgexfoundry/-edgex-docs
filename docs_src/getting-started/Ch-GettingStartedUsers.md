# Getting Started as a User

This section provides instructions for Users to get EdgeX up and running.
If you are a Developer, you should read [Getting Started as a Developer](./Ch-GettingStartedDevelopers.md).

EdgeX is a collection of more than a dozen micro services that
are deployed to provide a minimal edge platform capability.

You can download EdgeX micro service source code and build your own micro services.
However, if you do not have a need to change or add to EdgeX, then you do not need to download source code.
Instead, you can download and run the pre-built EdgeX micro service artifacts.

The EdgeX community builds and creates Docker images as well as Snap packages with each release.
The community also provides the latest unstable builds (prior to releases).

Please continue by referring to:

- [Getting Started using Docker](./Ch-GettingStartedUsersDocker.md)
- [Getting Started using Snaps](./Ch-GettingStartedSnapUsers.md)
