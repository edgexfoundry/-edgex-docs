# Getting Started with EdgeX Snaps

## Introduction

[Snaps](https://snapcraft.io/docs) are application packages that are easy to install and update while being 
secure, cross‚Äêplatform and self-contained.
Snaps can be installed on any Linux distribution with [snap support](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd).

Snap packages of EdgeX services are published on the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io). The list of all EdgeX snaps is available [below](#edgex-snaps).
