# Getting Started using Snaps

## Introduction

[Snaps](https://snapcraft.io/docs) are application packages that are easy to install and update while being 
secure, cross‚Äêplatform and self-contained.
Snaps can be installed on any Linux distribution with [snap support](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd).

Snap packages of EdgeX services are published on the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io). The list of all EdgeX snaps is available [below](#edgex-snaps).

## EdgeX Snaps
The following snaps are maintained by the EdgeX working groups:

Platform snap:

- [edgexfoundry](https://snapcraft.io/edgexfoundry): the main platform snap containing
all reference core services along with several other security, supporting, application, and device services.

Development tools:

- [edgex-ui](https://snapcraft.io/edgex-ui)
- [edgex-cli](https://snapcraft.io/edgex-cli)

Application services:

- [edgex-app-service-configurable](https://snapcraft.io/edgex-app-service-configurable)

Device services:

- [edgex-device-camera](https://snapcraft.io/edgex-device-camera)
- [edgex-device-modbus](https://snapcraft.io/edgex-device-modbus)
- [edgex-device-mqtt](https://snapcraft.io/edgex-device-mqtt)
- [edgex-device-rest](https://snapcraft.io/edgex-device-rest)
- [edgex-device-snmp](https://snapcraft.io/edgex-device-snmp)
- [edgex-device-grove](https://snapcraft.io/edgex-device-grove)

Other EdgeX snaps do exist on the public Snap Store ([search by keyword](https://snapcraft.io/search?q=edgex)) or private stores under brand accounts.

## Installing the `edgexfoundry` snap
[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-white.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/edgexfoundry)

This is the main platform snap which
contains all reference core services along with several other security, supporting, application, and device services.

The Snap Store allows access to multiple versions of the [EdgeX Foundry](https://snapcraft.io/edgexfoundry) snap using [channels](https://snapcraft.io/docs/channels). If not specified, snaps are installed
from the default `latest/stable` channel. 

You can see the current snap channels available for your machine's architecture by running the command:

```bash
snap info edgexfoundry
```

In order to install a specific version of the snap by setting the `--channel` flag.
For example, to install the Jakarta (2.1) release:

```bash
sudo snap install edgexfoundry --channel=2.1
```

To install the latest beta:
```bash
sudo snap install edgexfoundry --channel=latest/beta
# or using the shorthand
sudo snap install edgexfoundry --beta
```

Replace `beta` with `edge` to get the latest nightly build!

---

Upon installation, the following internal EdgeX services are automatically started:

- consul
- vault
- redis
- kong
- postgres
- core-data
- core-command
- core-metadata
- security-services (see [Security Services section](#security-services) below)

The following services are disabled by default:

- app-service-configurable (required for eKuiper)
- device-virtual
- kuiper
- support-notifications
- support-scheduler
- sys-mgmt-agent

Any disabled services can be enabled and started up using `snap set`:

```bash
sudo snap set edgexfoundry support-notifications=on
```

To turn a service off (thereby disabling and immediately stopping it) set the service to off:

```bash
sudo snap set edgexfoundry support-notifications=off
```

All services which are installed on the system as systemd units, which if enabled will automatically start running when the system boots or reboots.

### Configuring individual services
This snap supports configuration overrides via snap configure hooks which generate service-specific .env files which are used to
provide a custom environment to the service, overriding the default configuration provided by the service's `configuration.toml`
file. If a configuration override is made after a service has already started, then the service must be **restarted** via command-line
(e.g. `snap restart edgexfoundry.<service>`), or [snapd's REST API](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapd-api). If the overrides are provided via the snap configuration defaults
capability of a gadget snap, the overrides will be picked up when the services are first started.

The following syntax is used to specify service-specific configuration overrides for the edgexfoundry snap:

```
env.<service>.<stanza>.<config option>
```

For instance, to setup an override of core data's port use:

```bash
sudo snap set edgexfoundry env.core-data.service.port=2112
```

And restart the service:

```bash 
sudo snap restart edgexfoundry.core-data
```

!!! Note
    At this time changes to configuration values in the `[Writable]` section are not supported.

For details on the mapping of configuration options to Config options, please refer to [Service Environment Configuration Overrides](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go/blob/main/snap/README.md#configuration-overrides). 

### Viewing logs
To view the logs for all services in an EdgeX snap use the `snap log` command:

```bash
sudo snap logs edgexfoundry
```

Individual service logs may be viewed by specifying the service name:

```bash
sudo snap logs edgexfoundry.consul
```

Or by using the systemd unit name and `journalctl`:

```bash
journalctl -u snap.edgexfoundry.consul
```

These techniques can be used with any snap including application snap and device services snaps.

### Security services

Currently, The EdgeX snap has security (Secret Store and API Gateway) enabled by default. The security services constitute the following components:

- kong-daemon (API Gateway a.k.a. Reverse Proxy)
- postgres (kong's database)
- vault (Secret Store)

Oneshot services which perform the necessary security setup and stop, when listed using `snap services`, they show up as `enabled/inactive`:

- security-proxy-setup (kong setup)
- security-secretstore-setup (vault setup)
- security-bootstrapper-redis (secure redis setup)
- security-consul-bootstrapper (secure consul setup)

Vault is known within EdgeX as the Secret Store, while Kong+PostgreSQL are used to provide the EdgeX API Gateway.

For more details please refer to the snap's [Secret Store](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go/blob/main/snap/README.md#secret-store) and [API Gateway](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go/blob/main/snap/README.md#api-gateway) documentation.
