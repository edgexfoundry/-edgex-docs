# System Management Agent

!!! edgey "EdgeX 2.0"
    System Management Agent has been **deprecated** for EdgeX 2.0. While it is still available, it may be removed in a future release and no further develop is planned for it.

The EdgeX System Management Agent (SMA) microservice exposes the EdgeX management service API to 3rd party systems. In other words, the Agent serves as a proxy for system management service API calls into each micro service. See [System Management Agent](../../../microservices/system-management/Ch_SystemManagement/) for more details about this service.

    For EdgeX 2.0 the REST API provided by the System Management Agent has changed to use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for all responses and for all POST requests.
