# Rules Engine

EdgeX Foundry Rules Engine Microservice receives data from the instance of App Service Configurable running the `rules-engine` profile (aka app-rules-engine) via the EdgeX MessageBus. EdgeX uses `eKuiper` for the rules engine, which is a separate LF Edge project. See the [eKuiper Website](https://www.lfedge.org/projects/ekuiper/) for more details on this rules engine.
