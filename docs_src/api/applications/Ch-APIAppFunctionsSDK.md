# Application Services 

The App Functions SDK is provided to help build Application Services by assembling triggers, pre-existing functions and custom functions of your making into a functions pipeline. This functions pipeline processes messages received by the configured trigger.  See [Application Functions SDK](../../microservices/application/ApplicationFunctionsSDK.md) for more details on this SDK.

The App Functions SDK provides a RESTful API that all Application Services inherit from the SDK.
