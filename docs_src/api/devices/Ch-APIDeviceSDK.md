# Device Services

The EdgeX Foundry Device Service Software Development Kit (SDK) takes the Developer through the step-by-step process to create an EdgeX Foundry Device Service microservice. See [Device Service SDK](../../microservices/device/sdk/Ch-DeviceSDK.md) for more details on this SDK.

The Device Service SDK provides a RESTful API that all Device Services inherit from the SDK.
