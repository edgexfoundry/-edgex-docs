# Core Command

EdgeX Foundry's Command microservice is a conduit for other services to
trigger action on devices and sensors through their managing Device
Services. See [Core Command](../../../microservices/core/command/Ch-Command/)  for more details about this service.

The service provides an API to get the list of commands that
can be issued for all devices or a single device. Commands are divided
into two groups for each device:

-   GET commands are issued to a device or sensor to get a current value
    for a particular attribute on the device, such as the current
    temperature provided by a thermostat sensor, or the on/off status of
    a light.
-   SET commands are issued to a device or sensor to change the current
    state or status of a device or one of its attributes, such as
    setting the speed in RPMs of a motor, or setting the brightness of a
    dimmer light.
